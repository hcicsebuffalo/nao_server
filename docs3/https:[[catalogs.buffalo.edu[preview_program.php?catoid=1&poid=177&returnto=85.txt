Environmental Science BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Let’s face it-our planet needs scientists who know how to reduce air pollution, restore wetlands, protect national parks, address climate change … the list goes on and on. Some day that person could be you, especially if you’re passionate about the environment, you’re excited about using science and math to solve complicated problems, and you want a job that lets you travel the world and explore the great outdoors.
Visit the Environmental Science academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Environment and Sustainability department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
