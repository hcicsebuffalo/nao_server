Sociology BA
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
“Challenge the status quo.”
“Think outside the norm.”
“Make a social impact.”
These are just a few of the reasons why our recent sociology students chose this major. So, is it right for you? Yes, if you want to use science to understand people, study social life, and dig into critical issues like health, poverty and race. It’s a great choice for someone who’s ready to tackle tough questions and examine not only the choices that society makes, but the context around those choices.
Visit the Sociology academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
