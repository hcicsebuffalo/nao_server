Academic Requirements
Minimum 2.333 (C+) in all courses that fulfill a major requirement as well as maintain an overall GPA of at least a 2.000 to remain in good standing. Practical application of coursework is an integral part of the Music Theatre BFA. At a minimum, BFA students perform in four faculty led performances (musicals, drama theatre shows, university choir, or Zodiaque). Student productions provide a great opportunity for both directing and performance experience, but are not applicable to the performance requirement for the degree. BFA Students are required to audition each semester, but must have a 3.000 major GPA to be eligible to be cast. Students can begin performing as early as their second semester first year. BFA Students are also required to complete three practicums, which include crew assignments on one of the eight departmental productions each year.
Transfer Credit Policy
Students will be placed in the appropriate level of technique courses based on this evaluation, which may not correspond directly to student’s academic year. A core requirement of the Music Theatre BFA is the students’ practical work on and in productions. As performers, students need to be in residence at UB in order to complete degree requirements.
Curricular Plan
A Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time. Your actual plan may vary depending on point of entry to the university, course placement and/or waivers based on standardized test scores, earned alternative credit and/or college transfer credit.
