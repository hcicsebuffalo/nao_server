Approved substitutions: PSC 408, PSY 207, SOC 294, STA 119 and STA 119, ECO 480, EAS 308. However, students who take a course outside Geography that is equivalent to GEO 211 must complete an additional Geography elective to fulfill the requirement of 37 Geography credit hours.
Program Honors and Program Distinction
Students must complete an honors project under the supervision of a Geography faculty member. Each project is to be read and evaluated by a second faculty member in the department who has expertise in the area of the student’s project. Students who wish to complete an honors project must make arrangements with the appropriate faculty member by the end of the semester preceding the semester (or summer session) when the student expects to register for the honors course. Students must receive a grade of B or higher in the honors course. Students must also meet the remaining Program Honors criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. 
Majors who do not pursue a thesis but have exceptional grades are eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met.  These criteria are also found in the Academic Honors policy.
