#28. Systems program national ranking, 2019-2022. Source: csrankings.org
Systems research category introduction and description.
Computer Architecture and Hardware
Hardware and software issues from the circuit to the system have three main foci: Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits and systems, computer architecture, and computer security.
Distributed Systems and Networks
Research in networking and distributed systems focuses on enabling communication of and orchestrating coordination of a large number of computing nodes.
Edge Computing and Embedded Systems and Robotics
Hardware and software co-design on embedded/ASIC computing performance optimization.
High-Performance Computing
Focuses on efficient experimental and theoretical solutions to problems on state-of-the-art computational systems consisting of large numbers of computational elements, including clouds, clusters, grids, networks-of-workstations, massively parallel supercomputers, and GPU-based systems.
Mobile Computing
Mobile systems research focuses on the design and implementation of next-generation systems for mobile devices.  Research topics include mobile data management, wireless networks, sensing systems, static analysis and instrumentation for mobile apps, mobile image and video analytics, and secure and low-power hardware for mobile devices.
Operating Systems
Focuses on developing innovative system software and programming techniques to manage computer hardware, software resources, and common software-mediated services.
Programming Languages and Software Engineering
Programming Language research focuses on type systems, program logics, language-based and differential privacy and security; language, compiler, and run-time design for reliable systems; static and dynamic analyses for real-time Android; run-time visualization and verification; adaptive memory management; language concepts for database programming; logic- and constraint-based systems.
RESEARCH RANKING
Excelsior!
UB's institutional reputation in the field of computer science has improved dramatically over the last decade.  By the most valid measure, our national ranking has risen from 50th to 29th.
RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
Computer Vision for Robot Bees
Karthik Dantu owns the vision component of the RoboBee Initiative, led by the National Science Foundation and Harvard University.  The "eyes" that Dr. Dantu is integrating are laser-powered sensors that enable the mechanical bees to orient themselves in space.
