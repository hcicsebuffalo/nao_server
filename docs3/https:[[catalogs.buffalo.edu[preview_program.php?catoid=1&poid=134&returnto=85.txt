Industrial Engineering BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Do you ever look at a process or system and think, “Here’s how I’d make it better if I was in charge.”
If so, then welcome to industrial engineering-the perfect major for people who want to use science and math to improve efficiency and productivity. How should a hospital schedule its surgeries? Where is the best location for a new factory? How do we make autonomous vehicles safer to drive? If these types of questions get you excited, then come join us.
Visit the Industrial Engineering academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Industrial and Systems Engineering department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
