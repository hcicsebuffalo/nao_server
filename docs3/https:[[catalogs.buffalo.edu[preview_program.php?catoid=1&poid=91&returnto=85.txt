Notes
The department does require a GPA of 2.500 or higher in the following lower division courses to keep the status of statistics major: MTH 141LR, MTH 142LR and STA 119LEC/STA 119REC 
Students not attaining the 2.500 average will need to retake courses to improve their average or they will be removed from the program.
Students intending to pursue graduate work in statistics are strongly encouraged to take additional mathematics courses.
Academic Requirements
Minimum major GPA of 2.000 required for graduation.
All Statistics students will be academically reviewed at the end of each semester after grades are posted. Academic review standards are as follows:
Minimum UB GPA of 2.000
Minimum major GPA of 2.000
Students identified after academic review each semester who do not meet these requirements will be notified via their UB Email account. The first semester that students receive a warning notification they will be mandated to make an advising appointment before registering for next semester’s classes (enforced with a hold). Second semester of not meeting criteria will mandate that the student attend an SPHHP sponsored workshop on academic improvement and mandate them to meet with an academic advisor (enforced with service indicator). When a student is identified with 3 semesters of academic warning the student will be removed from the major. Academic reviews are conducted following Fall and Spring semesters only. Courses repeated during the winter and/or summer are not factored into the review.
Students who are academic dismissed from the Statistics BA major have one (1) opportunity to appeal to the program director.
