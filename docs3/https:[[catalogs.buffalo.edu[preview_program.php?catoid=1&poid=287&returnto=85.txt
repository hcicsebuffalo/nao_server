Academic Requirements
Students will be reviewed each semester after grades are posted and are required to have a minimum GPA of 2.5 in major classes (science and math) and at UB overall to be in good standing and graduate with a BS degree.
Students not meeting benchmarks will be placed in provisional status:
Students in provisional status will receive mandatory advisement. Students must complete a self-assessment of the previous semester and develop an action plan.
Students in provisional status at the end of their prerequisite courses will be removed from the major, and changed to Exploratory Transitions.
Students with 2 semesters of provisional status in the upper division courses will be removed from the major, and changed to Exploratory Transitions.
Program Honors and Program Distinction
Eligible students must maintain a GPA of 3.200 or higher in the required third and fourth-year pharmaceutical sciences courses. Students complete a minimum of six credits of undergraduate research (PHC 498), performed under the supervision of one faculty member on one project. This research can be performed over two semesters or full-time during the summer. These credits may be used as electives to fulfill the requirements for the BS degree program. Students must have the support and nomination of the supervising faculty research advisor and complete PHC 497 with a minimum grade of B. Students must also meet the remaining Program Honors criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. 
Majors who do not pursue a thesis but have exceptional grades are eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met.  These criteria are also found in the Academic Honors policy.
Students who successfully complete Program Honors and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript. Program Distinction is also noted on the official transcript.
