Bioinformatics and Computational Biology BS - Biological Sciences Concentration
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Use electronic health records to prevent future pandemics. Help analyze genetic data to develop new cancer drugs. Create advanced computer models that lead to more resilient ecosystems. If these things sound interesting to you-and if you like using science, math, data and statistics-then this program could be exactly what you’re looking for. This program is for students who want a highly interdisciplinary major, with the freedom to focus on biology, computer science or informatics (using data to improve health).
Visit the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Biological Sciences department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.

Elective courses as needed to complete the 120 credit hour total
Total Credits Required for Graduation: 120
Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Academic Requirements
A minimum combined GPA of 3.000 for required courses is required for retention in the major. At the end of every semester a review of all coursework is completed, and any student not meeting the GPA minimum for four consecutive semesters will be dismissed from the major.
Program Honors
Students with at least a 3.600 GPA may apply to the honors program fall of the third year. Accepted students take BIO 487 spring of the junior year and the senior year is devoted to laboratory research where the student completes six credits of honors-level, biological research BIO 497 in the laboratory of a UB faculty member. The research is presented at the departmental honors symposium at the end of spring semester. BIO 497 credits count for two of the required labs for the major and all the BIO 487/BIO 497 credits will be counted toward the total required for the major.
Students must also meet the remaining criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. Students who successfully complete the honors program and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript.
