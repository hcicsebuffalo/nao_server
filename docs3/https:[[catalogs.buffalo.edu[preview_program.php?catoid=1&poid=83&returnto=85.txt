Practical application of coursework is an integral part of the Theatre BFA, Performance Concentration. At a minimum, BFA students perform in three faculty led productions (either musical or drama theatre show). Student productions provide a great opportunity for both directing and performance experience but are not applicable to the performance requirement for the degree. BFA Students are required to audition each semester, but must have a 3.000 major GPA to maintain casting eligibility. Students can begin performing as early as their second semester first year. BFA Students are also required to complete three practicums, which include crew assignments on one of the eight departmental productions each year.
