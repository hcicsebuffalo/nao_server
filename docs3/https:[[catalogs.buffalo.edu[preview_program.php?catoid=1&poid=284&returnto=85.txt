Pharmacology and Toxicology BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
How does binge drinking affect teenagers’ brains? How do hormones affect our bodies? What effect do toxic chemicals have on our immune system? How can we replace addictive opioids with other pain management therapies? If these are the types of questions you’re interested in, then welcome to pharmacology-a program designed for students who are interested in the science behind drug therapy. As one student said, “The more I learned, the more I wanted to learn.”
Visit the Pharmacology and Toxicology academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Pharmacology and Toxicology department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
Admission Criteria
Minimum 2.700 GPA in major courses
Current UB students who are interested in applying to the Pharmacology and Toxicology BS in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences should submit the Program Application.

Learning Outcomes
The overall goal of the B.S. program in Pharmacology and Toxicology is to prepare students with a comprehensive understanding of the interactions of drug and toxin actions with living cells and tissues. Majors in our program are expected to master both the conceptual and practical aspects of pharmacology and toxicology, as well as fundamental laboratory techniques used in assessing drug action. This training provides students with an array of career opportunities including advanced study in either graduate or professional schools or for scientific careers in regulatory affairs, production analysis, product safety or sales, or as research scientists and/or drug information specialists.
