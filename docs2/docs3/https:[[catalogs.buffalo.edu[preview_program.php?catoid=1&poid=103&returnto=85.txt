Public Health BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Want to make a big impact? Then let’s talk about public health, where you can help entire communities become safer and healthier. How? By proactively reducing environmental risk factors, focusing on the root causes of diseases and injuries, and encouraging community-wide healthy behaviors. As one of our students said, “you’re affecting people at a population level, instead of waiting for someone to come with you with a specific issue.” So stop waiting-and keep reading.
