MESSAGE FROM THE DEAN
Support the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences
Your support is vital to the success of our school; it provides the difference between funding what is necessary and what is possible.

Your partnership and donation to the Boldly Buffalo campaign will:
allow our bright and hard-working students to fulfill their dreams and complete their degrees through scholarships and fellowships,
help advance the profession by funding groundbreaking research,
provide resources to furnish facilities and purchase the latest technologies for faculty and students,
prepare our graduates to enter the workforce ready to serve as leaders of tomorrow’s industry, and
make critical investments in recruiting and retaining the best students and faculty.
Together, let's lead.
With Deep Gratitude,
Kemper Lewis, PhD, MBA
Dean, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences
