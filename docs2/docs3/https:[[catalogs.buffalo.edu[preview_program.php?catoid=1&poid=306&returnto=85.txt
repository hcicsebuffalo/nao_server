Course Requirements
Mathematics Core (44 credits)
MTH 141LR - College Calculus I Credits: 4 OR
MTH 153LR - Honors Calculus I Credits: 4
 MTH 142LR - College Calculus 2 Credits: 4 OR
MTH 154LR - Honors Calculus 2 Credits: 4
 MTH 241LR - College Calculus 3 Credits: 4 OR
MTH 251LR - Honors Calculus 3 Credits: 4
 MTH 306LR - Introduction to Differential Equations Credits: 4 OR
MTH 326LR - Honors Diff Equations Credits: 4
 MTH 309LR - Introductory Linear Algebra Credits: 4 OR
MTH 323LR - Honors Linear Algebra Credits: 4
 MTH 311LR - Introduction to Higher Mathematics Credits: 4
MTH 337LEC - Introduction to Scientific and Mathematical Computing Credits: 4
MTH 419LR - Introduction to Abstract Algebra Credits: 4
MTH 420LR - Abstract Linear Algebra Credits: 4
MTH 431LR - Introduction to Real Variables I Credits: 4
MTH 432LR - Introduction to Real Variables II Credits: 4
Additional Course Requirements (9-12 credits)
One 300/400 level Mathematics course
Two 300/400 level Mathematics or Computer Science courses
Notes: 
Any 300/400-level MTH course, except for MTH 417 or MTH 399, MTH 495-MTH 499, which is not already being used towards another major requirement, is acceptable.
Any 300 or 400 level CSE courses, except for CSE 492 and CSE 494-CSE 496, are also approved.  
For these purposes, STA 301 and STA 301 is considered equivalent to MTH 411, and hence as a 400 level MTH course. Likewise, STA 302 and STA 302 is considered equivalent to MTH 412.
No other non-MTH courses can be used towards this requirement. MTH 431-MTH 432 and MTH 419-MTH 420 are designed for students who want intensive preparation in analysis and modern algebra, and are not good choices to just fill out a schedule.       
Total Credits Required for Major: 53-56
Additional Degree Requirements Include:
Additional coursework to fulfill UB Curriculum requirements
Elective courses as needed to complete the 120 credit hour total
Total Credits Required for Graduation: 120
Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Academic Requirements
Continuation in the major will be contingent on completing MTH 141 MTH 142 and MTH 241  (or Honors equivalent or transfer-equivalent courses), with a 2.500 GPA or higher. Students with a Calculus GPA below 2.500 may be eligible for provisional admission. Contact 716-645-8785 or math-undergrad@buffalo.edu to make an advising appointment.
Transfer Credit Policy
All UB Mathematics majors must complete at least four upper-division mathematics courses, numbered 311-489, excluding MTH 323, MTH 326, and MTH 399, at UB. 
Program Honors and Program Distinction
Majors are eligible for Program Honors upon completion of an honors thesis under the guidance of a faculty advisor. Students typically complete MTH 499 in the fall semester and MTH 497 in the spring semester, although the timing is flexible and students may complete the thesis before their last semester. Students must also meet the remaining Program Honors criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. 
Majors who do not pursue a thesis but have exceptional grades are eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met. These criteria are also found in the Academic Honors policy.
Students who successfully complete Program Honors and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript. Program Distinction is also noted on the official transcript.
Curricular Plan
A Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time. Your actual plan may vary depending on point of entry to the university, course placement and/or waivers based on standardized test scores, earned alternative credit and/or college transfer credit.
