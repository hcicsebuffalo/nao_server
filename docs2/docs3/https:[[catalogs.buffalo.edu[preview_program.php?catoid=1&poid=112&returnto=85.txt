Political Science BA - Advanced Concentration
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Politics and governments affect your life on a daily basis-from the environment and education to civil rights and wars. That’s why it’s so important to understand (and question!) the political structures all around us, regardless of your personal politics. This program is for students who like thinking about institutions, power, government and law-including how (and why) they work the way they do. If that sounds like you, then you’re the perfect candidate for this major. 
Visit the Political Science academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Political Science department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
