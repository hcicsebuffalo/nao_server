Spanish BA
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
As one of our students said, they chose Spanish because, “I knew the importance of being bilingual and the rapid growth of the Spanish-speaking population.” In fact, Spanish is one of the five most common languages on the planet, spoken from Spain and South America to Mexico and the U.S.-which is the second-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world. This program is for people who love learning about languages and enjoy being immersed in some of the world’s most diverse cultures.
Visit the Spanish academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Romance Languages and Literatures department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
