Geographic Information Science BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
How do we track the spread of contagious diseases? Can we use satellites to create a more accurate model of air pollution? How can geographic-based data from social media help us respond to natural disasters faster and more efficiently? If these are the types of questions that make you more curious about our planet-and if you enjoy using software and technology and thinking about where things happen-then UB’s geographic information science program is designed for you.
Visit the Geographic Information Science academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Geography department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.

Notes
*Statistics Substitution (GEO 211): If you have already completed one of the following Stats courses, you will not need GEO 211. Approved substitutions: PSC 408, PSY 207, SOC 294, STA 119, STA 119, ECO 480. However, students who take a course outside Geography that is equivalent to GEO 211 must complete an additional Geography elective to fulfill the requirement of 37 Geography credit hours.
Total Credits Required for Major: 45
Additional Degree Requirements Include:
Additional coursework to fulfill UB Curriculum requirements
Elective courses as needed to complete the 120 credit hour total
Total Credits Required for Graduation: 120
Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Academic Requirements
Minimum GPA of 2.000 overall.
Program Honors and Program Distinction
Students must complete an honors project under the supervision of a Geography faculty member. Each project is to be read and evaluated by a second faculty member in the department who has expertise in the area of the student’s project. Students who wish to complete an honors project must make arrangements with the appropriate faculty member by the end of the semester preceding the semester (or summer session) when the student expects to register for the honors course. Students must receive a grade of B or higher in the honors course. Students must also meet the remaining Program Honors criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. 
Majors who do not pursue a thesis but have exceptional grades are eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met.  These criteria are also found in the Academic Honors policy.
Curricular Plan
A Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time. Your actual plan may vary depending on point of entry to the university, course placement and/or waivers based on standardized test scores, earned alternative credit and/or college transfer credit.
