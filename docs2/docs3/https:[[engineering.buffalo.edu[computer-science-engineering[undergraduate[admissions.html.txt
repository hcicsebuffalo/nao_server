WHY CHOOSE CSE?
Established and Growing
Over the past three years, we have hired six new faculty members: in algorithms, databases, data mining, electronic commerce, natural language processing, and networks. Computer science was first organized as a department at UB in 1967—one of the first in the U.S.—and merged with computer engineering in 1998 to form the present department. 




MORE REASONS TO CHOOSE CSE
EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING
Engineering Intramurals
An engineering intramural is any problem-based extracurricular engineering activity that provides an authentic (i.e., “real-world”) learning experience for students.
