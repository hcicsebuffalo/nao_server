German BA - German Language and Linguistics Concentration

Let’s start with 100 million reasons-that’s the number of people who speak German around the world.

This program is for students who want to be fluent in German, study the largest economy in the European Union, and learn more about the birthplace of Einstein, Arendt, Nietzsche, Beethoven and other world-famous Germans.
