Computational Linguistics BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
“Alexa!” “Siri!” “Hey, Google!” If you’ve ever asked your smartphone for directions, messaged with a chatbot, or typed a random question into a search box, you already know the power of computational linguistics. Now, you can study how this technology works-and find ways to make it even better-in a rapidly growing field that brings together language and technology.
Visit the Computational Linguistics academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Linguistics department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
Admission Criteria
Current UB students seeking admission to the Computational Linguistics BS will be added to the major upon request by completing the College of Arts and Sciences Request to Change a Major - Form.
