Center of Excellence in Information Systems Assurance Research and Education
Higher education in Cybersecurity and a greater number of professionals with Cybersecurity expertise are essential to meet the challenges and threats to the National Information Infrastructure. The goals of this Center of Academic Excellence in Information Systems Assurance, Research and Education (CEISARE@Buffalo) are graduate education and coordinated research in computer security and information assurance by faculty members from several schools and departments at the University at Buffalo.
State University of New York at Buffalo has been designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education in 2002 and has been re-designated for the academic years 2022-2027. In 2009, the University had been designated as a CAE-R (Center of Excellence in Research) and in 2014 re-designated as CAE-R for the academic years 2014-2023. The Center had earlier been certified to have met the Information Systems Security Professionals, NSTISSI No. 4011 and Systems Administrators, CNSSI No. 4013 for 2008-2013.
In 2010, CEISARE's research and educational activities have been expanded to Biomedical Data Security.
