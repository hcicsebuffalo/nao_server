Geography BA - Earth Systems Science Concentration
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Do you love studying maps? Are you curious about why things happen where they do? If you like thinking about our impact on the planet, then there’s a place for you here-where you can study everything from world hunger and hazardous waste to erosion, trade, transportation and more. How does dust in the atmosphere affect climate change? What is the optimum amount of soil water content for a forest to thrive under extreme temperatures? Why do some maps omit places that are popular with people who are LGBTQ? Join us and find out.
Visit the Geography academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.

Notes
*Statistics Substitution (GEO 211): If you have already completed one of the following Stats courses, you will not need GEO 211. Approved substitutions: PSC 408, PSY 207, SOC 294, STA 119, STA 119, ECO 480, EAS 305, ECO 380. However, students who take a course outside of Geography that is equivalent to GEO 211 must complete an additional Geography elective.
Total Credits Required for Major: 45-49
Additional Degree Requirements Include:
Additional coursework to fulfill UB Curriculum requirements
Elective courses as needed to complete the 120 credit hour total
Total Credits Required for Graduation: 120
Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Program Honors and Program Distinction
Students must complete an honors project under the supervision of a Geography faculty member. Each project is to be read and evaluated by a second faculty member in the department who has expertise in the area of the student’s project. Students who wish to complete an honors project must make arrangements with the appropriate faculty member by the end of the semester preceding the semester (or summer session) when the student expects to register for the honors course. Students must receive a grade of B or higher in the honors course. Students must also meet the remaining Program Honors criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. 
Majors who do not pursue a thesis but have exceptional grades are eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met.  These criteria are also found in the Academic Honors policy.
Curricular Plan
A Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time.
