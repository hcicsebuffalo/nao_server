Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Academic Requirements
Students must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 in the major. All courses taken by a student that are included in the Urban and Public Policy Studies curriculum will be used in calculation of the major GPA. For example, if the curriculum requires a student to select two courses from a particular section and the student completes three courses from that section, all three courses would be used to calculate the student’s major GPA.
Each course taken may be counted only once and applied toward only one requirement (e.g. SOC 348 may be used as a required advanced course or an advanced elective but not both).
The Urban and Public Policy Studies major may not be combined with any other major to form a joint major. Students pursuing a double major may use a maximum of two advanced (300- or 400-level) courses towards both majors. For example a student completing a double major between Urban and Public Policy Studies and Sociology may apply only two advanced level sociology courses toward completion of the Urban and Public Policy Studies major.
Transfer Credit Policy
For students not continuously registered at UB or who are newly admitted transfer students, courses taken more than 10 years prior to the date of admission or readmission to the University may constitute no more than 20% of the coursework applied to the Urban and Public Policy Studies major. Students who have more than 20% of course work over 10 years old will be required to complete additional courses in the major. At least 50 percent of coursework toward the major must be completed at UB.
Program Distinction
A student in this major is eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met. Criteria are found under Academic Honors in the Policy and Procedure section of this Catalog. Program Distinction is noted on the official transcript.
