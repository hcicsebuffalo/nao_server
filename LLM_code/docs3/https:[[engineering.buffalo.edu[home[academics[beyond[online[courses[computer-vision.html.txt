About the Course
This course explores foundational concepts of the rapidly expanding research field of computer vision, which aims to make computers see and interpret the world as humans do. The course covers crucial elements that enable computer vision: digital signal processing, neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Learners are equipped to identify key application areas and understand the digital imaging process. They gain hands-on experience writing computer vision programs through online labs using MATLAB and supporting toolboxes.
Computer Vision Basics is a collaboration of the UB Department of Computer Science and Engineering, UB Center for Industrial Effectiveness, MathWorks and other industry partners.
