Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of all requirements, the student will have knowledge of:
Developed an individual toolbox of technical skills combined with the ability to be fearless and inventive in individual exploration.
The ability to work resourcefully, safely and independently on print projects of increasing complexity and depth.
Developed the skills and confidence to initiate and complete self-driven research.
Developed skills for critical analysis and its articulation. This includes discursive skills for presenting work, explaining concepts and critically engaging the work of others.
Acquired an understanding of the historical roles of printmaking and the contemporary practice of print media in art and visual culture.
“Learning printmaking helps students trust their intuition and to understand the logic of materials in a very tangible yet indirect way. In a time when academically gifted students feel great pressure to appear verbally confident at every point of the creative process, they often avoid uncertain or vulnerable stages in their studio work and narrow their creative options prematurely. In printmaking, ideas often unfold over a series of distinct stages, making it an ideal medium to teach art students how to become more flexible and responsive thinkers and doers. The very indirectness of printmaking is of great benefit to the development of artists”
—- Phyllis McGibbon, Artist and Professor, Wellesley College
