Legal Studies BA
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
What makes a law unjust? Which children are most at risk for becoming part of the juvenile justice system? What role has race played in the evolution of democracy? If these are the types of questions you like to ask (and answer), then legal studies might be the right program for you. This major is designed for students who prefer a broad, interdisciplinary approach to learning, and want the freedom to explore different topics throughout the social sciences.
Visit the Legal Studies academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Social Studies Interdisciplinary department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.

Notes
*Continuation in the major will be contingent on completing PSC 101  and HIS 161 or HIS 162  with a minimum grade of C in each
Academic Requirements
Students must maintain a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.000 in the major. All courses taken by a student that are included in the Legal Studies curriculum will be used in calculation of the major GPA. For example, if a curriculum requires a student to select two courses from a particular section and the student completes three courses from that section, all three courses would be used to calculate a student’s major GPA. The Legal Studies major may not be combined with any other major to form a joint major.  Students pursuing a double major may use a maximum of two advanced (300 or 400 level) courses towards both majors. For example a student completing a double major between Legal Studies and sociology may take only two advanced level sociology courses for completion of the Legal Studies major.
For students not continuously registered at UB or who are newly admitted transfer students, courses taken more than 10 years prior to the date of admission or readmission to the University may constitute no more than 20% of a major program in the Legal Studies major.
Transfer Credit Policy
At least 50 percent of coursework toward the major must be completed at UB. Courses taken more than 10 years prior to the date of admission to the University may constitute no more than 20% of a major program in the Legal Studies major.
Program Distinction
A student in this major is eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met. Criteria are found under Academic Honors in the Policy and Procedure section of this Catalog. Program Distinction is noted on the official transcript.
