Notes
*Students are permitted to use MAE 177 or EAS 999TR177 (general graphics for transfer students) to satisfy this requirement. However, CIE 177 is strongly preferred for Environmental Engineering majors. The MAE 177 or EAS 999TR177 should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with these courses already completed. View our Graphics Requirement website for more information on graphics alternatives and self-study packages.
**Students are permitted to take EAS 305 in lieu of CIE 308, however CIE 308 is strongly preferred for Environmental Engineering majors. The EAS 305 option should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with EAS 305 already completed or when significant extenuating circumstances prevent a student from completing CIE 308 in a timely manner. In the latter case, students should consult the department before enrolling in EAS 305.
***Students are permitted to take alternative programming courses CSE 115 or EAS 240 in lieu of EAS 230, however EAS 230 is strongly preferred for Environmental Engineering majors. The alternative programming courses should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with CSE 115, EAS 240, or EAS 999TRCP (general programming for transfer students) already completed. View our Computer Programming Requirement website for more information on the programming alternatives and self-study packages.
****Only three credits of the informal courses (CIE 496, CIE 498, CIE 499 and EAS 496) can be counted as a technical elective toward fulfillment of degree requirements. 300/400-level courses outside the above departments may also be taken as technical electives with prior approval from the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Courses cannot be double-counted as fulfilling both a technical elective requirement and an environmental engineering program requirement, an environmental engineering elective, and/or an earth science elective.
