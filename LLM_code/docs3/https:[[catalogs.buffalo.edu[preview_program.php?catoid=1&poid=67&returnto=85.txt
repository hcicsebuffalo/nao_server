Computer Science BA
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Do you think in algorithms? Are you good at math? Do you enjoy solving problems? Then welcome to computer science, where you can learn how developers build billion-dollar apps, use artificial intelligence to address climate change, and protect computer systems from cyber attacks. As one student put it, UB’s computer science program is for people who like logic and theory, but also want the “practicality and applicability” of being a developer or programmer.
Visit the Computer Science academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Computer Science and Engineering department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.

Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Notes
Students taking MTH 121/MTH 122 or MTH 131 should note that certain CSE courses (e.g. CSE 331 and CSE 396) require MTH 142 as a pre-requisite. Students planning to take such courses are advised to take MTH 141/MTH 142 
All courses are not offered every semester. Please check the undergraduate schedule ahead for planning.
*Students are permitted to take alternative programming courses EAS 230 or EAS 240 in lieu of CSE 115, however CSE 115 is strongly preferred for Computer Science majors. The alternative programming courses should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with EAS 230, EAS 240, or EAS 999TRCP (general programming for transfer students) already completed. View our Computer Programming Requirement website for more information on the programming alternatives and self-study packages.
Academic Requirements
Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must have a minimum GPA of 2.000 in technical classes (engineering, math, and science classes) to be in good standing and graduate with an undergraduate degree. To maintain academic standards and determine eligibility for continued enrollment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences reviews the academic records of all students in an approved undergraduate SEAS major. This academic review is conducted at the end of each fall and spring semester.
View the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Academic Review Policy
Transfer Credit Policy
Students seeking a BA degree in computer science must complete at least six required CSE courses at UB, and at least four of these courses must be at the 300 or 400 level (excluding CSE 492 CSE 494 and CSE 499).
