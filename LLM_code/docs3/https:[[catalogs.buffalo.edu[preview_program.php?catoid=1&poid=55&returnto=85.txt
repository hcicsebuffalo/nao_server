Civil Engineering BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Build a better world-literally. UB’s civil engineering program is for students who get excited about things like designing earthquake-resistant skyscrapers, creating climate-resilient water systems, and constructing bridges that bring communities together. As one of our students put it, “I didn’t want to be doing the same thing every day.” If you’ve ever marveled at the Pyramids of Giza, the Great Wall of China, the Hoover Dam or the efficiency of your local highway system, then this program may be your road to success.
Visit the Civil Engineering academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering department page  for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.

Notes
*Students are permitted to use MAE 177 or EAS 999TR177 (general graphics for transfer students) to satisfy this requirement. However, CIE 177 is strongly preferred for Civil Engineering majors. The MAE 177 or EAS 999TR177 should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with these courses already completed. View our Graphics Requirement website for more information on graphics alternatives and self-study packages.
**Students are permitted to take EAS 305 in lieu of CIE 308, however CIE 308 is strongly preferred for Civil Engineering majors. The EAS 305 option should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with EAS 305 already completed or when significant extenuating circumstances prevent a student from completing CIE 308 in a timely manner. In the latter case, students should consult the department before enrolling in EAS 305.
***Students are permitted to take alternative programming courses CSE 115 or EAS 240 in lieu of EAS 230, however EAS 230 is strongly preferred for Civil Engineering majors. The alternative programming courses should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with CSE 115, EAS 240, or EAS 999TRCP (general programming for transfer students) already completed. View our Computer Programming Requirement website for more information on the programming alternatives and self-study packages.
****Students are permitted to use PHY 151 and PHY 152 in lieu of PHY 158, however PHY 158 is preferred for engineering majors.
Academic Requirements
Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must have a minimum GPA of 2.000 in technical classes (engineering, math, and science classes) to be in good standing and graduate with an undergraduate degree.  To maintain academic standards and determine eligibility for continued enrollment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences reviews the academic records of all students in an approved undergraduate SEAS major. This academic review is conducted at the end of each fall and spring semester.
View the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Academic Review Policy
Transfer Credit Policy
Students seeking an undergraduate engineering degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must complete 30 undergraduate credit hours of junior/senior level courses required in their major at the University at Buffalo.
