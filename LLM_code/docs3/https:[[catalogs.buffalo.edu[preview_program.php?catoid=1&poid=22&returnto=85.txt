Biochemistry BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
 Trying to choose between bio and chem? Why not both? This major is for people who want to understand the chemistry behind biological processes, so you can do things like look for the causes of Alzheimer’s disease, develop more efficient crops and understand the impact of viruses like COVID-19. Whether you’re thinking about going to med school or dental school, or you want to start your career right after graduation, a biochemistry degree from UB will help set you apart.
Visit the Biochemistry academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Biochemistry department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
Admission Criteria
Minimum major GPA of 3.000 required
Current UB students who are interested in applying to the Biochemistry BS in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences should submit the Program Application.
