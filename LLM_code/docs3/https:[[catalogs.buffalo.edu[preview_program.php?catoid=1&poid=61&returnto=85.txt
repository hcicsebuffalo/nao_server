Cognitive Science BA
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
“Cognitive science called to me because it took every academic interest and showed me a real-life application,” said one UB student. “It’s a means of not just studying people, but making a difference in those people’s lives.”
Think about how you understand the words you’re reading right now. Consider what makes you smart, what makes you creative, or how we decide what “intelligence” means in people and machines. 
If you want to explore these types of questions-and use the answers to make the world a better place-then cognitive science might be right for you.
Visit the Cognitive Science academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.

Notes
*Continuation in the major will be contingent on completing PSY 342 with a minimum grade of B-
Total Credits Required for Major: 42-54
Additional Degree Requirements Include:
Additional coursework to fulfill UB Curriculum requirements
Elective courses as needed to complete the 120 credit hour total
Total Credits Required for Graduation: 120
Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This chart should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Academic Requirements
Students must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 in the major. All courses taken by a student that are included in the Cognitive Science curriculum will be used in calculation of the major GPA. For example, if a curriculum requires a student to select two courses from a particular section and the student completes three courses from that section, all three courses would be used to calculate a student’s major GPA.  
Each course taken may be counted only once and applied toward only one requirement (e.g., PHI 320 may be taken as a core courses or applied to the advanced course section, but not both). Many courses in the advanced course section have prerequisite requirements. For more information students should check individual course descriptions in the undergraduate catalog and/or speak with the Cognitive Science advisor. The Cognitive Science major may not be combined with any other major to form a joint major. Students pursuing a double major may use a maximum of two advanced (300- or 400-level) courses toward both majors. For example, a student completing a double major between Cognitive Science and Psychology may apply only two advanced level psychology courses toward completion of the Cognitive Science major.
Transfer Credit Policy
For students not continuously registered at UB or who are newly admitted transfer students, courses taken more than 10 years prior to the date of admission or readmission to the University may constitute no more than 20% of the coursework applied to the Cognitive Science major. Students who have more than 20% of course work over 10 years old will be required to complete additional courses in the major. At least 50 percent of coursework toward the major must be completed at UB.
Program Distinction
A student in this major is eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met. Criteria are found under Academic Honors in the Policy and Procedure section of this Catalog. Program Distinction is noted on the official transcript.
Curricular Plan
A Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time.
