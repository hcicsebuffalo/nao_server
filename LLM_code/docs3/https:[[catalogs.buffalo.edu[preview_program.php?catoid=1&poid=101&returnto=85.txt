International Studies BA
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Students in the Social Sciences Interdisciplinary BA - International Studies Concentration program can request to be moved to the International Studies BA. 
The problems and events in today’s world are “far too complex to only assess them through a narrow lens,” as one of our students said. That’s why we developed this program-for people who want a global understanding of the world, and value a broad, interdisciplinary approach. If you love learning about different cultures and foreign languages-and you want the flexibility to explore different topics within international studies-then keep reading.
Visit the Social Science Interdisciplinary academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Social Science Interdisciplinary department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.

Academic Requirements
Students must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 in the major. All courses taken by a student that are included in a student’s chosen curriculum within the Social Sciences Interdisciplinary Programs will be used in the calculation of the major GPA.

For students not continuously registered at UB, courses taken more than 10 years prior to the date of readmission to the University may constitute no more than 20% of the major.
The Social Sciences Interdisciplinary Degree Programs do not support joint majors.
Students pursuing a double major may only overlap a total of two courses at the 300- or 400-level.
Transfer Credit Policy
Courses taken more than 10 years prior to the date of admission may constitute no more than 20% of a major program in the Social Sciences Interdisciplinary Degree Programs. At least 50 percent of coursework toward the major must be completed at UB.
