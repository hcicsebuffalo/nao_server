Notes
*Students are permitted to take alternative programming courses EAS 240 or CSE 115 in lieu of EAS 230, however EAS 230 is strongly preferred for Aerospace Engineering majors. The alternative programming courses should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with EAS 240, CSE 115, or EAS 999TRCP (general programming for transfer students) already completed. View our Computer Programming Requirement website for more information on the programming alternatives and self-study packages. 
**Students are permitted to use CIE 177 or EAS 999TR177 (general graphics for transfer students) to satisfy this requirement. However, MAE 177 is strongly preferred for Aerospace Engineering majors. The CIE 177 or EAS 999TR177 should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with these courses already completed. View our Graphics Requirement website for more information on graphics alternatives and self-study packages.
***Transfer students with Senior standing must replace MAE 278 with an SEAS technical elective**. Transfer students with Junior standing should consult with an MAE academic adviser to determine if they should take MAE 278 or replace it with an SEAS technical elective**.
****Students are permitted to use PHY 151 and PHY 152 in lieu of PHY 158, however PHY 158 is preferred for engineering majors.
*****Any 300/400 level 3-credit course that is offered by a department within SEAS (i.e. EAS, ENS, MAE, CIE, IE, etc.) can be used as an SEAS technical elective. See the Academic Advising Report (AAR) for a complete list of course options.
Total Credits Required for Major: 111
Additional Degree Requirements Include:
Additional coursework to fulfill UB Curriculum requirements
Total Credits Required for Graduation: 128
Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Academic Requirements
Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must have a minimum GPA of 2.000 in technical classes (engineering, math, and science classes) to be in good standing and graduate with an undergraduate degree.  To maintain academic standards and determine eligibility for continued enrollment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences reviews the academic records of all students in an approved undergraduate SEAS major. This academic review is conducted at the end of each fall and spring semester. View the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Academic Review Policy
Transfer Credit Policy
Residency Requirement: Students seeking an undergraduate engineering degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must complete 30 undergraduate credit hours of junior/senior level courses required in their major at the University at Buffalo.
