Neuroscience BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
How does drug addiction actually work? What controls our hunger and thirst? How do we recognize emotions in other people? What causes Down syndrome? As a neuroscience major, youâ€™ll use your brain to learn about brains (and the rest of the nervous system, of course). This program is designed for students who are good at bio and chem and are up for the challenge of studying the most complex organ in the human body.
Visit the Neuroscience academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Neuroscience department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
Admission Criteria
Minimum 2.500 UB GPA
Minimum 2.500 GPA in Major courses
Current UB students who are interested in applying to the Neuroscience BS in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences should submit the Program Application.

Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Notes
*During 2022-23 academic year this requirement ran as NRS 401 for 2 credits + NRS 402 for 2 credits. The 2 credit NRS 401 alone does not satisfy this requirement. 
Academic Requirements
Students are required to maintain a 2.500 major GPA as well as a 2.500 University GPA to remain in the program. Students who fall below 2.500 will be given one academic semester and one summer session to raise their major GPA at or above 2.500.
Program Honors
Students must complete a minimum of 12 hours of approved 498 credit (with 9 credits coming from the same lab experience) and present their research at a department approved research presentation. Students must also meet the remaining criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. Students who successfully complete the honors program and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript.
Curricular Plan
A Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time. Your actual plan may vary depending on point of entry to the university, course placement and/or waivers based on standardized test scores, earned alternative credit and/or college transfer credit.

Learning Outcomes
Students will develop literacy in the neurosciences with particular emphasis on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make up the central nervous system as well as the physiology and pathophysiology of disease and treatment of disease states that will make them qualified candidates for a wide variety of biomedical career opportunities, including; professional school (i.e. medical school, dental school, law school), advanced research, pharmaceutical research and development, and other health professions
Students will be able to reframe the current challenges of understanding how the brain functions in health and disease to develop insights into how the brain controls behavior.
Students in the program will be able to relate the basic connectivity and anatomy of the human brain and how such connectivity may impact disease states.
Students will be able to coalesce information across a wide range of basic sciences and disciplines, applying them to a clinical and translational understanding of the brain.
Students will be able to integrate the organization of the central nervous system and the physiology and pathophysiology of disease and treatment of disease states to create an inclusive background of modern medical neuroscience.
Students will be able to relate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie both behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in the central nervous system to changes in central nervous system physiology in both adult and developing central nervous systems resulting in diverse and debilitating neurological disease.
Students will be able to apply their understanding of the neurosciences at the level of individual genes, cells, organs, neural circuits, and animal/human behavior.
Students will be able to evaluate how these processes can become dysfunctional and give rise to neurological and neuropsychiatric disease.
