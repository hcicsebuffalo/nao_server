Computer Science BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Do you think in algorithms? Are you good at math? Do you enjoy solving problems? Then welcome to computer science, where you can learn how developers build billion-dollar apps, use artificial intelligence to address climate change, and protect computer systems from cyber attacks. As one student put it, UB’s computer science program is for people who like logic and theory, but also want the “practicality and applicability” of being a developer or programmer.
Visit the Computer Science academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Computer Science and Engineering department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
