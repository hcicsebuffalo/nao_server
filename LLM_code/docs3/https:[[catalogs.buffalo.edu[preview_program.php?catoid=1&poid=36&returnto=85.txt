Biotechnology BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
What do cheese, biofuels and genetic engineering have in common? They’re all possible thanks to biotechnology-a field that uses living organisms to create useful products. If you like working hands-on in a lab and you’re good at bio, then this might be the perfect program for you-especially if you want a flexible major that can lead to careers in environmental research, pharmaceuticals, the food and beverage industry and many other paths.
Visit the Biotechnology academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Biotechnical and Clinical Laboratory Sciences department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
Admission Criteria
Minimum 2.000 GPA overall
Minimum 2.500 GPA in prerequisite courses
Current UB students who are interested in applying to the Biotechnology BS in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences should submit the Program Application.
