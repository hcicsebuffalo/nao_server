Computer Engineering BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Computer engineering is where software meets hardware. It’s for people who want to understand the code and the circuits that make it possible for us to have smartphones, robots, driverless vehicles, computer networks, medical sensors and millions of other devices. In this program, you’ll get to work with your head and your hands as you discover how to be a translator, making software and hardware work together as efficiently as possible. It’s part computer science, part electrical engineering … and all pretty amazing.
Visit the Computer Engineering academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Computer Science and Engineering department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.

Notes
*Students are permitted to take alternative programming courses EAS 230 or EAS 240 in lieu of CSE 115, however CSE 115 is strongly preferred for Computer Engineering majors. The alternative programming courses should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with EAS 230, EAS 240, or EAS 999TRCP (general programming for transfer students) already completed. View our Computer Programming Requirement website for more information on the programming alternatives and self-study packages. 
**Students are permitted to take EE 178 in lieu of CSE 241, however CSE 241 is strongly preferred for Computer Engineering majors. EE 178 should only be used if the student has already completed this course, or is considering a double major in Electrical Engineering.
***Students are permitted to use PHY 151 and PHY 152 in lieu of PHY 158, however PHY 158 is preferred for engineering majors.

Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Academic Requirements
Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must have a minimum GPA of 2.000 in technical classes (engineering, math, and science classes) to be in good standing and graduate with an undergraduate degree.  To maintain academic standards and determine eligibility for continued enrollment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences reviews the academic records of all students in an approved undergraduate SEAS major. This academic review is conducted at the end of each fall and spring semester.
View the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Academic Review Policy
Transfer Credit Policy
Students seeking an undergraduate engineering degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must complete 30 undergraduate credit hours of junior/senior level courses required in their major at the University at Buffalo.
