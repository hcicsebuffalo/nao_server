Medicinal Chemistry BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Want to make a big impact? Start by thinking small-at the molecular level, to be precise. As a chemistry student, you’ll get a whole new perspective on everything around us as you study the composition of matter, then use your knowledge to make our lives better. How? By developing pharmaceuticals that are more effective, making sure our water is safe to drink, developing new materials for longer-lasting products … the list goes on and on.
Visit the Chemistry academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Chemistry department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
