Psychology BA

Psych is one of those majors that applies to just about anything you want to do in life. As one of our students said, “It touches everything, from the sciences, to the law, to politics, to interpersonal relationships.” This program is designed for people who are fascinated by human behavior and want to use science to understand how people form opinions and make decisions. If you think this area of study might be the right fit for you, then keep reading to learn more about psychology-and yourself.

Knowledge Base in Psychology: Students should demonstrate fundamental knowledge and comprehension of the major concepts, theoretical perspectives, historical trends, and empirical findings to discuss how psychological principles apply to behavioral problems.
Scientific Inquiry and Critical Thinking: The skills in this domain involve the development of scientific reasoning and problem solving, including effective research methods.
Ethical and Social Responsibility in a Diverse World: The skills in this domain involve the development of ethically and socially responsible behaviors for professional and personal settings in a landscape that involves increasing diversity.
Communication: Students should demonstrate competence in writing and in oral and interpersonal communication skills.
Professional Development: The emphasis in this goal is on application of psychology-specific content and skills, effective self-reflection, project-management skills, teamwork skills, and career preparation.
