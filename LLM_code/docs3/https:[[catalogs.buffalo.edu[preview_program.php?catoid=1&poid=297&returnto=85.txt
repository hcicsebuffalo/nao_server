Engineering Physics BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Many of the complex problems you’ll find throughout the world need interdisciplinary solutions, which is why many students choose a major that combines multiple fields. That’s exactly what you’ll find with engineering physics, which is designed for students who want an in-depth understanding of fundamental physics-plus the problem-solving skills of an engineer. As an added bonus, engineering physics lets you keep your options open between physical sciences and engineering, whether you’re going to grad school or straight into your career.
Visit the Engineering Physics academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Electrical Engineering department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.

Technical Electives (6 credits)
Two technical electives, see the Academic Advising Report (AAR) for a complete list of course options.
Students may choose to enroll in technical electives of interest. Technical electives allow undergraduates to explore broad areas of interest in engineering or physics. In principle, any 300 or 400 level course of technical nature may be considered as an unrestricted technical elective (for example, courses from SEAS, the Department of Mathematics, the Department of Physics, and others). Some restrictions may apply in cases in which courses have large overlap with other courses in the program. See director of undergraduate studies for clarification. 
Total Credits Required for Major: 111
Additional Degree Requirements Include:
Additional coursework to fulfill UB Curriculum requirements
Elective courses as needed to complete the 128 credit hour total
Total Credits Required for Graduation: 128
Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Notes
 *Students are permitted to take alternative programming courses CSE 115 or EAS 999TRCP in lieu of EAS 240, however EAS 240 is strongly preferred for Engineering Physics majors. The alternative programming courses should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with CSE 115 or EAS 999TRCP (general programming for transfer students) already completed. View our Computer Programming Requirement website for more information on the programming alternatives and self-study packages. 
**Students are permitted to take CSE 241 in lieu of EE 178, however EE 178 is strongly preferred for Engineering Physics majors. CSE 241 should only be used if the student has already completed this course or is considering a double major in Computer Engineering. 
***Students are permitted to use PHY 151 and PHY 152 in lieu of PHY 158, however PHY 158 is preferred for engineering majors.
Academic Requirements
Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must have a minimum GPA of 2.000 in technical classes (engineering, math, and science classes) to be in good standing and graduate with an undergraduate degree. To maintain academic standards and determine eligibility for continued enrollment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences reviews the academic records of all students in an approved undergraduate SEAS major. This academic review is conducted at the end of each fall and spring semester. View the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Academic Review Policy
Program Honors
A student must excel in course work as well as complete a Senior Thesis.  The Senior Thesis is prepared under the supervision of a Department of Physics faculty member. Credit for this is obtained through PHY 497. The thesis is reviewed by the student’s mentor and the Undergraduate Director. The thesis should be at least 20 pages long and the student must have completed at least one semester of PHY 497. 
Students must also meet the remaining criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. Students who successfully complete the honors program and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript.
Curricular Plan
A Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time. Your actual plan may vary depending on point of entry to the university, course placement and/or waivers based on standardized test scores, earned alternative credit and/or college transfer credit.
