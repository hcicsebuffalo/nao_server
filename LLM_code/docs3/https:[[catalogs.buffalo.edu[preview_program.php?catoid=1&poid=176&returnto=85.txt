Environmental Sustainability BA
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
The bad news is that people are destroying the planet. The good news is that change-makers like you can help save it. How? By learning how people interact with the environment in one complex ecosystem, so we can reduce the negative impact of humans without causing undue harm to society. It’s certainly not easy. But if you’re ready to help solve complicated issues that affect billions of people, then the world could really use your help.
