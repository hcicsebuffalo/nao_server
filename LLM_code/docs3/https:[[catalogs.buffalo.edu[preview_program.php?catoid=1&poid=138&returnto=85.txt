Academic Requirements
Students must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 in the major. All courses taken by a student that are included in a student’s chosen curriculum will be used in calculation of the major GPA. For example, if a curriculum requires a student to select two courses from a particular section and the student completes three courses from that section, all three courses would be used to calculate a student’s major GPA.
For students not continuously registered at UB or who are newly admitted transfer students, courses taken more than 10 years prior to the date of admission or readmission to the University may constitute no more than 20% of a major program in the Social Sciences Interdisciplinary Degree Programs. Students who have more than 20% of course work over 10 years old will be required to complete additional courses in the major.
Social Sciences Interdisciplinary Degree Programs does not support joint majors.
Students pursuing a double major may use a maximum of two advanced courses towards both majors. For example a student completing a double major between an SSC major and sociology may take only two advanced level sociology courses for completion of the SSC major. The Social Sciences Interdisciplinary Degree Program reserves the right to disallow any double major based on excessive course duplication between the two majors.
Transfer Credit Policy
At least 50 percent of coursework toward the major must be completed at UB.
Program Distinction
A student in this major is eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met. Criteria are found under Academic Honors in the Policy and Procedure section of this Catalog. Program Distinction is noted on the official transcript.
