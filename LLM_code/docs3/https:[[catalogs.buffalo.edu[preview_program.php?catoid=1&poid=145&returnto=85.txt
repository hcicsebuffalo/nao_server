Global Gender Studies BA
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
How is reproductive justice activism shaping global politics? How can we protect the rights of the LGBTQI+ community through laws and policies? How do we analyze gendered and sexualized images in art, media and culture? How have ideologies of gender and sexual identities shaped systems of inequality? If these types of questions fascinate you, then let’s talk about global gender studies. Maybe you always knew you wanted to be a gender studies major, or maybe you didn’t even know it existed until now. Either way, you are welcome here-in a program that’s incredibly relevant and timely, anywhere in the world, in nearly every aspect of society. 
Visit the Global Gender Studies academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
