Total Credits Required for Major: 70-71
Additional Degree Requirements Include:
Additional coursework to fulfill UB Curriculum requirements
Elective courses as needed to complete the 120 credit hour total
Total Credits Required for Graduation: 120
Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Academic Requirements
A minimum GPA of 2.000 following the completion of BIO 200, BIO 201/BIO 211, BIO 303 and BIO 305 is required for retention in the Biological Sciences major.
A minimum GPA of 2.000 in biology courses and a minimum GPA of 2.000 in required chemistry, physics and mathematics courses is needed for degree conferral.
Program Honors
Students with at least a 3.600 GPA may apply to the honors program fall of the third year. Accepted students take BIO 487 spring of the junior year and the senior year is devoted to laboratory research where the student completes six credits of honors-level, biological research BIO 497 in the laboratory of a UB faculty member. The research is presented at the departmental honors symposium at the end of spring semester. BIO 497 credits count for two of the required labs for the major and all the BIO 487/BIO 497 credits will be counted toward the total required for the major.
Students must also meet the remaining criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. Students who successfully complete the honors program and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript.
