“History offers the most versatility in terms of learning about science, art, religion, politics and culture.”
Our students say it best-history is the key to understanding what happened, why it happened, and the impact it has on our lives today. And it’s one of the most flexible majors, since it lets you explore so many different interests. Ready for a bright future? Keep scrolling.

Notes
Breadth requirement: A course that seems to fall into two breadth areas may be used to satisfy the requirement of one area.  A course used to fulfill a requirement for a double major, joint major, or a minor in another subject may not also fulfill a requirement for the history major.
Total Credits Required for Major: 36
Additional Degree Requirements Include:
Additional coursework to fulfill UB Curriculum requirements
Elective courses as needed to complete the 120 credit hour total
Total Credits Required for Graduation: 120
Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Academic Requirements
Each HIS course must be completed with a minimum grade of C- (1.667), to count toward the History BA requirements.  An overall grade point average of at least 2.150 in courses counting toward the history requirements is required to graduate. UB Seminars (198/199 courses) may not count toward major requirements.
Transfer Credit Policy
Transfer students majoring in history may receive credit for up to five history courses (15 credit hours) but must take seven upper-level history courses, including the two 400-level seminars, at UB. Transfer courses will be evaluated and will only be applicable to the BA if they directly articulate to or otherwise satisfy one of the History BA requirements.
Program Honors
Majors who complete at least four history courses with a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.330 (B+) or who have a letter of support from a faculty member willing to supervise their project are eligible to apply for admission to the History department Honors Program. Students participate in HIS 497 and HIS 497 and produce a substantial thesis based on primary source research. Students must also meet the remaining criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. Students who successfully complete the honors program and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript.
