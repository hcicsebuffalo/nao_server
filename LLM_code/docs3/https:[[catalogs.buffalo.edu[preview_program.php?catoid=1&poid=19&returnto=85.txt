Architecture BS
Return to: Majors and Combined Degrees
Architects do far more than design buildings. As makers of space and place, they shape our lives in countless ways, and their work has far-reaching impacts on everything from climate change and housing affordability to health equity and social justice. As an architecture major, you’ll learn by doing-and making-emerging as a “citizen architect” ready to address complex questions. Can we design buildings to harvest energy instead of waste it? How are race and architecture connected? Can a robot make construction safer? Come find out for yourself.
Visit the Architecture academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Architecture department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.

Students can complete an additional 18 credits of non-ARC liberal arts credits through the pathways, leaving at least an additional 9 non-ARC liberal arts elective credits necessary to meet the requirements of this degree. The curricular plan below outlines this recommendation. 
Notes
*Students must complete calculus (MTH 121 or MTH 131) and physics (PHY 101/AED 101) prior to the start of their second-year fall to remain on track with program completion.
Total Credits Required for Major: 102
Additional Degree Requirements Include:
Additional coursework to fulfill UB Curriculum requirements
Elective courses as needed to complete the 128 credit hour total
Total Credits Required for Graduation: 128
Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Academic Requirements
A minimum of 128 semester credit hours and minimum GPA of 2.500 in all major courses is required to graduate with the pre-professional Bachelor of Science in Architecture. Grades lower than C- in any design studio and media course will not count toward University at Buffalo Architecture degree requirements.
Students are reviewed on their progress within the pre-professional Bachelor of Science in Architecture by University at Buffalo Architecture on a semesterly basis. This review determines the student’s eligibility to continue onto the next level in the undergraduate preprofessional program. A minimum cumulative GPA of 2.500 in all required architecture curricular courses and a minimum cumulative UB GPA of 2.000 is required for satisfactory academic progress and progression through the undergraduate program. Grades lower than C- in any design studio and media course will not count toward the preprofessional Bachelor of Science in Architecture degree requirements, and a grade of F in any design studio may result in dismissal from University at Buffalo Architecture. 
Transfer Credit Policy
A minimum of 42 ARC-prefixed credit hours must be completed at the University at Buffalo to satisfy the University at Buffalo Architecture’s academic residency requirement.
Program Distinction
A student in this major is eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met. Criteria are found under Academic Honors in the Policy and Procedure section of this Catalog. Program Distinction is noted on the official transcript.

Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of all requirements, the student will have knowledge of:
Understanding issues and methods of architectural design, representation and construction
Becoming culturally aware, technically competent and environmentally responsible
First year studio sequence: basic literacy in design principles and fundamentals using two- and three- dimensional media, and to become familiar with the tools, materials, techniques and values that enable an architectural design proposition
Second year studio sequence: the basic knowledge of historical precedents, site planning and analyzing context and expands the range of design methods
Third year studio sequence: students are introduced to a variety of performative criteria that govern the workings of buildings to understand how dynamic forces contribute to the constructional, functional and spatial formation of architecture
Fourth year fall semester studio: students synthesize the social needs of collective domesticity with the real world constraints of site, climate and program
