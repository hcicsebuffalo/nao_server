One 200/300/400-level Technical Elective (3 credits minimum)
Specifically, any course at these levels having one of the following prefixes: EAS, CE, BE, CIE, CSE, EE, ENS, IE, MAE, BIO, CHE, GLY, MTH, MDI, PHC, PHY, BCH, BPH, MIC, PGY, PMY, and STA. Some courses with the above prefixes are disallowed because their content overlaps with that of required courses for the BS degree. These are: BE 202, BE 305, BE 308, BE 309, BE 310, CIE 308, CIE 354, EAS 305, EAS 496, EE 305, MAE 335, MAE 336, MAE 338, MAE 381, MAE 431,  CHE 251, CHE 319, CHE 320, CHE 349, MTH 337, MTH 411, MDI 332, STA 301, STA 301, STA 427, STA 427, and any CE or other course already required for the degree. In some instances, graduate courses may be used as TEs; students should consult with an advisor if considering this option.
Two Chemical Engineering Technical Electives (6 credits minimum)
These are 300- or 400-level courses with prefix CE that are not already required for the degree. Additionally, the following courses from Civil, Structural, and Environmental Engineering (CSEE) can be applied to fulfill the CE technical elective requirement: CIE 334, CIE 340, CIE 343, CIE 441, CIE 442, CIE 444. These courses relate to environmental engineering, which is a field of interest in chemical engineering. You must obtain permission from CSEE to enroll in any of these courses.
Students may also use 2 credits of EAS 496 + 1 credit of CE 496 as a technical elective. 
Notes
Students are be limited to one instance/3 credits of any 496/498/499 course to count for degree requirements. Courses graded Pass/Fail (P/F) cannot count toward the CE degree requirements. Note that CE 497 does not satisfy a technical elective requirement. As described within Departmental Honors Requirements, it is a component of the departmental honors program.
* Students are permitted to take BIO 201 or BIO 305 in lieu of CE 220, however CE 220 is strongly preferred for Chemical Engineering majors. The BIO 201 or BIO 305 option should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with these courses already completed or when they are pursuing a pre-health major that requires BIO 201 or BIO 305.
**Students are permitted to take alternative programming courses EAS 240 or CSE 115 in lieu of EAS 230, however EAS 230 is strongly preferred for Chemical Engineering majors. The alternative programming courses should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with EAS 240, CSE 115, or EAS 999TRCP (general programming for transfer students) already completed. View our Computer Programming Requirement website for more information on the programming alternatives and self-study packages.
***Students are permitted to use PHY 151 and PHY 152 in lieu of PHY 158, however PHY 158 is preferred for engineering majors.
Total Credits Required for Major: 111
Additional Degree Requirements Include:
Additional coursework to fulfill UB Curriculum requirements
Total Credits Required for Graduation: 128
Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Academic Requirements
Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must have a minimum GPA of 2.000 in technical classes (engineering, math, and science classes) to be in good standing and graduate with an undergraduate degree. To maintain academic standards and determine eligibility for continued enrollment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences reviews the academic records of all students in an approved undergraduate SEAS major. This academic review is conducted at the end of each fall and spring semester.
View the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Academic Review Policy
Transfer Credit Policy
Students seeking an undergraduate engineering degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must complete 30 undergraduate credit hours of junior/senior level courses required in their major at the University at Buffalo.
Students must satisfy a departmental residency requirement that stipulates that a maximum of five courses from another school may be used as substitutes for required (16 total) and elective (2 total) CE courses. CBE places no limits (beyond those already imposed by the University and School of Engineering) on the number of BIO, CHE, MTH, PHY, EAS, general technical electives, and general education transfer credits that are applied to BS degree requirements.
Program Honors
Eligible students must achieve a GPA of 3.200 or higher in all required chemical engineering courses. Requirements for honors also include 6 credits of individual work over two semesters supervised by a member of the faculty and participation in the department’s research fair. Student enrolls in either CE 496 or CE 498  during the first semester, which may be used to satisfy one of the CE technical elective requirements for the degree. During the second semester the student enrolls in CE 497, which culminates in the completion and defense of an undergraduate thesis. The three credits obtained via participation in CE 497 are in addition to the standard requirement for the CE degree. Students must also meet the remaining criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. Students who successfully complete the honors program and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript.
