Two UB projects could make this process more efficient and expand the capabilities of machine learning. \\nShare This\\nPrint\\nRelated Links\\nKaiyi Ji, PhD\\nDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering\\n“Our ultimate goal is to apply this large scale bilevel optimization to different learning fields, robots and communication networks. ”\\nKaiyi Ji, Assistant Professor\\nDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering\\nEach of the National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded projects focus on bilevel optimization, something that principal investigator and computer science and engineering assistant professor Kaiyi Ji says has been in practice, outside of computer science, for decades.\\n“Bilevel optimization was introduced very early, in the 1960s. It’s used in the decision-making processes in finance and marketing,” Ji says. “It helps decide whether the current plan is good enough, or if you need to adjust. Bilevel optimization, in machines, has gotten increased attention because it really is the framework for many machine learning models like meta learning or other complex learning paradigms.”\\nA better way to learn\\nAssistant professor Kaiyi Ji\\nTraditionally, computer scientists have worked with single-level optimization. To train a machine learning model, the programmer would develop the model’s function; essentially, telling the model what it will learn. However, to effectively train a machine learning model – and teach it how to learn – programmers need to attach several other parameters. These “hyper parameters” train the model, and are essential to its function, but they can be time-consuming to build, according to Ji.\\nBilevel optimization uses machine learning to set the model’s hyperparameters on the upper level and uses the lower level to develop the model parameters. The two levels of the machine communicate to determine which hyper parameters train the model most effectively.\\n“The further tuning of the hyper parameters is based on feedback,” Ji says. “The upper level gives the hyper parameters to the lower level, and the lower level gives feedback to the upper level. The basic procedure is to optimize again and again until we see the final hyper parameters form.”\\nBilevel optimization is sometimes used in urban planning. In this scenario, the upper-level problem might involve optimizing the placement and capacity of transportation hubs like bus stops or train stations. The lower-level problem may be to optimize the flow of passengers or vehicles through the transportation network. The upper level considers decisions made in the lower level, as it works to minimize transportation costs. \\nTwo approaches to advance machine learning\\nBilevel optimization helps optimize placement of bus stops and train stations. \\nThe existing theory and practice of bilevel optimization only work for small sets of data and small-scale machine learning models. Ji is lead principal investigator (PI) on the first project that will develop the theory, algorithm and application for bilevel optimization in large sets of data and larger machine learning models like networks. Even with bilevel optimization, it will still take several days to train a machine on a relatively moderate model, according to Ji. His goal with the first project is to develop more efficient and feasible bilevel optimization algorithms and the theory behind it.\\n“Without theory, we are without design. You have no direction,” Ji says. “Our ultimate goal is to apply this large scale bilevel optimization to different learning fields, robots and communication networks.”\\nJi is a PI on the second NSF project, led by a faculty member at Rice University, Distributed Bilevel Optimization in Multi-Agent Systems, addresses a broader aspect of bilevel optimization and could help implement the practice for modern day use.\\nBilevel optimization in several fields like machine learning, signal processing, communication, optimal control and energy to power systems – whether using small-scale or large-scale data – has primarily focused on single-agent systems. These single-agent systems feature one machine that learns and trains itself. However, most applications in power systems, communication and energy often require problem solving in multi-agent distributed networks. According to Ji, his second project will determine how to implement bilevel optimization in these networks that feature several machines, each connecting to a server.\\nThe project examines bilevel optimization in three different types of multi-agent systems, including decentralized, federated and distributed. While each type of system is different, Ji compares distributed bilevel optimization to the relationship a medical doctor has with their patients.  \\n“In a decentralized system, the different agents each communicate with the same server, but these agents do not communicate with each other,” Ji says. “Each agent is like the patient. They have their own private record, so they will not transmit or communicate this information to the other patients. The server can be regarded as the doctor who communicates with each patient.”\\nDeveloping a feasible and practical algorithm for bilevel optimization in multi-agent systems will take time, but Ji is confident this idea can enhance the efficiency of major power networks.\\nEach project builds upon the other, according to Ji, and together, has the potential to transform the way society’s critical systems.\\n“We will first try to develop the efficient distributed bilevel project with theory, and then apply it,” Ji says. “This will improve the communication networks and power networks.”\\nJi is working with Rice University associate professor Shiqian Ma on each of the projects\\nUB is actively monitoring developments related to COVID-19.

A second chance leads to a true calling.  Photo credit: Onion Studio\\n“Students need to be exposed to basic, preliminary engineering concepts before high school. You\\'ve got to get them in the pipeline in middle school. Make it fun, creative, exciting. ”\\nLavone Rodolph\\nComputer Engineering BS \\'03, MS \\'05, PhD Candidate \\'18\\nPublished April 3, 2017\\nThis content is archived.\\nby Christian Miller\\nWhen Lavone Rodolph was laid off by the major defense contractor that had employed him for five years, he took it as a blessing.   It was his chance to come back to UB to earn his PhD.\\nToday, Lavone invents innovative ways to speed data transfer in computer networks.  The goal is to optimize network efficiency and hasten data traffic rates; the means is building multipath overlay virtual networks on existing physical networks and writing software that minimizes network traffic bottlenecks. He is advised by Tevfik Kosar.\\nHis other passion is stepping out of the lab and into the community, personifying STEM achievement for Buffalo schoolchildren and post-secondary students.\\nIn high school, Lavone himself was a beneficiary of UB\\'s STEM community outreach programs.  During sophomore year at Buffalo\\'s Hutch Tech (Hutchinson Central Technical) high school, UB\\'s Science and Technology Enrichment Program (STEP) and Buffalo Engineering Awareness for Minorities (BEAM) programs guided him into STEM, specifically computer engineering.\\nAt UB, he joined the university-level version of STEP, the Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP).  Junior year, he won the Computer Science and Engineering Mathematics (CSEMS) Scholarship;  senior year, the Kaplan Scholarship.\\nAfter his years in industry, it was time to give back, to assume the leadership role that he\\'d been preparing for, maybe inadvertently, his entire life.  Now on the other side of the desk, he teaches the CSTEP summer research methods seminar and BEAM tutorials on engineering fundamentals such as UNIX, HTML, and the mathematical engine Maple.\\nIn 2012, he got involved with Joseph Gardella\\'s Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Partnership (ISEP), an NSF-funded collaborative that brings together the Buffalo Public Schools, UB, Buff State, and the Buffalo Science Museum to engage middle school and high school students in STEM.  \"Students need to be exposed to basic, preliminary concepts before high school.  You\\'ve got to get them in the pipeline in middle school,\" Lavone said. \"Make it fun, creative, exciting.\"  One of the projects he leads is development of an Android app whose \"bottom line is to give them exposure to programming.\"\\nHe cites two favorite quotes that guide and inspire him: \"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me\" (Philippians 4:13) and \"I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed.\" (Booker T. Washington)\\nAs for the future, Lavone has had his fill of defense contractors, at which stable employment depends on uninterrupted streams of federal dollars.  \"I\\'d love to be a tenured university professor someday,\" to realize his dual mission of research and outreach.\\nConnect With Us\\nComputer Science and Engineering\\n338 Davis Hall\\nBuffalo, New York 14260-2500\\n(716) 645-3180\\nQuick Links\\nWhy Choose CSE?\\nNews & Events\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nGive to CSE\\nContact Us\\nAdmissions\\nUndergraduate Admissions\\nGraduate Admissions\\nExplore Further\\nGet Involved\\nEngineering and Applied Sciences Alumni Association\\nSupport SEAS\\nCollaborate with UB\\nOn This Website\\nAbout Us\\nUndergraduate Programs\\nGraduate Programs\\nResearch\\nPeople\\nNews & Events\\nFull Site Map\\nInformation For\\nStudents\\nFaculty and Staff\\nAlumni\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

He is also the president of the UB chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), which was founded in 1973 and is the nation’s largest association dedicated to fostering Hispanic leadership in STEM. At UB, the club coordinates MentorSHPE, an undergraduate mentoring program.\\nSebastian Cisneros with other SHPE members at the 2019 SHPE National Convention in Phoenix, Arizona.\\n“My favorite part about the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers is the amount of career opportunities that come with being involved with the club. ”\\nSebastian Cisneros, undergraduate student\\nComputer science\\nWhere are you from?\\nI am from Jackson Heights in Queens, New York.\\nWhy did you choose to go into engineering?\\nSince I was little I was interested in how machines and computers worked. That interest developed over time, but I would say that learning about robotics in my high school really solidified my decision to go into engineering.\\nWhat do you like most about engineering at UB?\\nI like that there are many opportunities to improve your skills and work on projects. Participating in BattleBots and hackathons were very rewarding experiences for me.\\nTell us about your involvement in the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE).\\nI initially got involved with SHPE because my older relative was in SHPE and told me I should check it out. It was nice to be around others who shared similar interests with me, and came from a similar culture as well. What motivated me to become president was the ability to help others, just like previous members helped me.\\nWhat's your favorite part of being in SHPE?\\nMy favorite part about SHPE is the amount of career opportunities that come with being involved with the club. It’s always an exciting moment when a member receives an internship or full-time job offer after all their hard work. \\nIs there anything new or particularly exciting that your organization is working on?\\nAt the moment we have been talking about the possibility of working on a BattleBot. This bot would be for our own learning experience, and not necessarily for use in the UB BattleBot competition.  \\nWhat are you working on righrt now?\\nCurrently I am trying to learn a bit more about front end development in order to work on a few personal projects with my peers.\\nWhat are you passionate about?\\nSince working with robots in high school, I’ve had an interest in robotics and artificial intelligence. However, outside of school work I’ve always been passionate about skateboarding.\\nHas there been a particular faculty or staff member that has been formative during your time at UB?\\nThere have been a few moments when certain professors have said something that has really stuck with me. One such moment that comes to mind is when Professor Ethan Blanton took a moment to talk to us about how imposter syndrome can affect anyone, and we are all capable of being successful.\\nWhat are your future plans?\\nIdeally, I want land a full-time offer that lets me work right after graduation. I want to be able to support my parents so they can finally rest after all the hard work they’ve done to get me where I am now.\\nWhat is your advice for prospective students?\\nMy advice to prospective students would be to try and not fall into the trap of not needing to study because your first semester or two are easy. Aside from that I think it’s important to try and get involved with clubs that interest you at UB, as they could one day lead to career opportunities.\\nLearn more about UB's chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) here.\\nConnect With Us\\nComputer Science and Engineering\\n338 Davis Hall\\nBuffalo, New York 14260-2500\\n(716) 645-3180\\nQuick Links\\nWhy Choose CSE?\\nNews & Events\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nGive to CSE\\nContact Us\\nAdmissions\\nUndergraduate Admissions\\nGraduate Admissions\\nExplore Further\\nGet Involved\\nEngineering and Applied Sciences Alumni Association\\nSupport SEAS\\nCollaborate with UB\\nOn This Website\\nAbout Us\\nUndergraduate Programs\\nGraduate Programs\\nResearch\\nPeople\\nNews & Events\\nFull Site Map\\nInformation For\\nStudents\\nFaculty and Staff\\nAlumni\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

Look at light reflection in the eyes\\nQuestion: Which of these people are fake? Answer: All of them. Credit: www.thispersondoesnotexist.com and the University at Buffalo.\\nUniversity at Buffalo deepfake spotting tool proves 94% effective with portrait-like photos, according to study\\nBy Melvin Bankhead III\\nRelease Date: March 10, 2021\\nShare This\\nPrint\\nSiwei Lyu\\n“The two eyes should have very similar reflective patterns because they’re seeing the same thing. It’s something that we typically don’t typically notice when we look at a face. ”\\nSiwei Lyu, SUNY Empire Innovation Professor\\nDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering\\nBUFFALO, N.Y. – University at Buffalo computer scientists have developed a tool that automatically identifies deepfake photos by analyzing light reflections in the eyes.\\nThe tool proved 94% effective with portrait-like photos in experiments described in a paper accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing to be held in June in Toronto, Canada.\\n“The cornea is almost like a perfect semisphere and is very reflective,” says the paper’s lead author, Siwei Lyu, PhD, SUNY Empire Innovation Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. “So, anything that is coming to the eye with a light emitting from those sources will have an image on the cornea.\\n“The two eyes should have very similar reflective patterns because they’re seeing the same thing. It’s something that we typically don’t typically notice when we look at a face,” says Lyu, a multimedia and digital forensics expert who has testified before Congress.\\nThe paper, “Exposing GAN-Generated Faces Using Inconsistent Corneal Specular Highlights\\n(24.3 MB),” is available on the open access repository arXiv.\\nCo-authors are Shu Hu, a third-year computer science PhD student and research assistant in the Media Forensic Lab at UB, and Yuezun Li, PhD, a former senior research scientist at UB who is now a lecturer at the Ocean University of China’s Center on Artificial Intelligence.\\nTool maps face, examines tiny differences in eyes\\nWhen we look at something, the image of what we see is reflected in our eyes. In a real photo or video, the reflections on the eyes would generally appear to be the same shape and color.\\nHowever, most images generated by artificial intelligence – including generative adversary network (GAN) images – fail to accurately or consistently do this, possibly due to many photos combined to generate the fake image.\\nLyu’s tool exploits this shortcoming by spotting tiny deviations in reflected light in the eyes of deepfake images.\\nTo conduct the experiments, the research team obtained real images from Flickr Faces-HQ, as well as fake images from www.thispersondoesnotexist.com, a repository of AI-generated faces that look lifelike but are indeed fake. All images were portrait-like (real people and fake people looking directly into the camera with good lighting) and 1,024 by 1,024 pixels.\\nThe tool works by mapping out each face. It then examines the eyes, followed by the eyeballs and lastly the light reflected in each eyeball. It compares in incredible detail potential differences in shape, light intensity and other features of the reflected light.\\n‘Deepfake-o-meter,’ and commitment to fight deepfakes\\nWhile promising, Lyu’s technique has limitations.\\nFor one, you need a reflected source of light. Also, mismatched light reflections of the eyes can be fixed during editing of the image. Additionally, the technique looks only at the individual pixels reflected in the eyes – not the shape of the eye, the shapes within the eyes, or the nature of what’s reflected in the eyes.\\nFinally, the technique compares the reflections within both eyes. If the subject is missing an eye, or the eye is not visible, the technique fails.\\nLyu, who has researched machine learning and computer vision projects for over 20 years, previously proved that deepfake videos tend to have inconsistent or nonexistent blink rates for the video subjects.\\nIn addition to testifying before Congress, he assisted Facebook in 2020 with its deepfake detection global challenge, and he helped create the “Deepfake-o-meter,” an online resource to help the average person test to see if the video they’ve watched is, in fact, a deepfake.\\nHe says identifying deepfakes is increasingly important, especially given the hyper-partisan world full of race-and gender-related tensions and the dangers of disinformation – particularly violence.\\n“Unfortunately, a big chunk of these kinds of fake videos were created for pornographic purposes, and that (caused) a lot of … psychological damage to the victims,” Lyu says. “There’s also the potential political impact, the fake video showing politicians saying something or doing something that they’re not supposed to do. That’s bad.”\\nMedia Contact Information\\nMedia Relations (University Communications)\\n330 Crofts Hall (North Campus)\\nBuffalo, NY 14260-7015\\nTel: 716-645-6969\\nub-news@buffalo.edu\\nUB is actively monitoring developments related to COVID-19.

Emerging Practices (Art & Technology) engages the latest technologies, scientific processes and best practices available. It also reclaims, alters and appropriates existing technologies through creative re-use for communicative cultural purposes. Students engage in deeply experimental technological creative practices, positioning them to anticipate and shape future art movements, media forms and research fields.\\nThe BFA degree focuses on intensive work in Emerging Practices (Art & Technology), supported by a smaller, more defined program of general studies in the liberal arts.&nbsp;Students in the BFA also take a 2-semester capstone course, resulting in a senior thesis exhibition. Because this option includes the development of a cohesive body of work, the BFA is considered particularly relevant for students who wish to continue on to an MFA program.\\nReturn to: Majors and Combined Degrees\\n\\na\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

With the new computer science curriculum, you can really explore different areas, such as software, hardware and networking, and artificial intelligence and find what really interests you. ”\\nLisa Kanbur, undergraduate student\\nComputer science and engineering\\nLisa Kanbur is the director of DivTech, previously known as UB Scientista, a student organization dedicated to empowering “underrepresented demographics majoring in Computer Science and Engineering by providing a robust campus community, online resources and opportunities, and a network of talented role models.” With the support of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, DivTech brings together students in technology and provides them with opportunities on and off-campus, such as attending the annual Grace Hopper Celebration, a global gathering of women in tech.\\nWhere are you from?\\nI'm from Oswego, New York. \\nWhy did you choose to go into computer science?\\nI chose to go into computer science after I took a course in high school. I struggled through a lot of the course, but at the same time felt challenged by the content in a way that was different from my other classes. I started exploring all the different possibilities within computer science and I think this freedom of the numerous opportunities that involved tech is what influenced my decision to go into computer science and engineering.\\nWhat do you like most about engineering at UB?\\nEngineering at UB has allowed me to become involved in so many things. Through clubs in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering I have found a sense of community with people that motivate me and inspire me every day. I have also been able to explore other interests of mine, such as the humanities, while pursuing my computer science degree. With the new computer science curriculum, you can really explore different areas, such as software, hardware and networking, and artificial intelligence and find what really interests you. Engineering at UB also makes it really easy to pursue other interests. Many of my classmates have minors or double majors in fields that are not part of SEAS, so you have a chance to explore other classes and fields. \\nWhat motivated you to be a leader of DivTech?\\nLisa Kanbur at WeCode, a student-run conference for women in tech, held at Harvard University in Spring 2018. She attended with other members of UB DivTech.\\nI have been involved with DivTech since my freshman year. At that time, it was known as UB Scientista, and the club had a whole different aim than it does now. Through my involvement with this club, I met so many awesome women in tech who served as my mentors and eventually became my friends. They provided me with an example of something I could look up to and work towards, which was something I didn't even realize I needed as a freshman. But luckily, I found an amazing community of women in tech. I wanted to become Director because I know how important that experience was for me as a freshman and sophomore, and I wanted to be able to do the same for other students. \\nWhat's your favorite part of being in DivTech?\\nMy favorite part about being in DivTech is my awesome eboard that I get to work with this year. I think we make a great team and we all truly understand the importance of this club, along with the benefits of a good support system for women in tech. This makes working together so enjoyable!\\nWhat has DivTech been up to?\\nLast semester we ran a series of Coffee Hours in conjunction with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering where students got to have discussions with DivTech and CSE faculty about diversity and inclusion, systemic racism and sexism, and other important topics! In addition, students could also have more personal discussions with faculty about their own experiences. These served as a great forum for discussion and education about important topics, along with steps we can take to ensure all students feel welcome and appreciated in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. \\nWhat are you passionate about?\\nI'm extremely passionate about increasing and advocating for diversity in STEM, especially in my own Department of Computer Science and Engineering. The diversity and inclusion clubs and initiatives that I have been a part of have provided me with so many opportunities that have allowed me to develop both educationally and professionally, whether through networking opportunities or attending conferences.\\nIn 2019, I attended the Grace Hopper Celebration in Orlando, Florida where I met a ton of other amazing women in tech. It was attended by over 26,000 women from around the world. Because of my experience there, I was able to come back to UB and utilize the things I learned not only in a technical aspect, but within my community as well. I learned so much from that experience and I feel extremely fortunate to have been able to come back and spread the knowledge that I gained. \\nHas there been a particular faculty or staff member that has been formative during your time at UB?\\nProfessor Ethan Blanton has been someone that has cheered me on since he met me freshman year. I feel like any time I need motivation or reassurance he has always been there to help me out, whether it's listening to me vent and offering advice or telling stories about old technology. \\nWhat are your future plans?\\nI hope to work as a software engineer after graduation, specifically working on data analytics and architecture and backend engineering. \\nWhat is your advice for prospective students?\\nI know the initial transition to UB and SEAS can be a little overwhelming since there are so many things going on. It's important to put yourself out there and explore things that you may be interested in. Join clubs, talk to professors and people in your classes and start early. You may not realize it, but a lot of other people are going through the same thing and it's important to remember that. By putting yourself out there, you can form meaningful connections with those around you to create a sense of community. Everyone has a place here; it will just take some effort to find where you thrive! \\nTo learn more about DivTech, contact ubdivtech@gmail.com\\nConnect With Us\\nComputer Science and Engineering\\n338 Davis Hall\\nBuffalo, New York 14260-2500\\n(716) 645-3180\\nQuick Links\\nWhy Choose CSE?\\nNews & Events\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nGive to CSE\\nContact Us\\nAdmissions\\nUndergraduate Admissions\\nGraduate Admissions\\nExplore Further\\nGet Involved\\nEngineering and Applied Sciences Alumni Association\\nSupport SEAS\\nCollaborate with UB\\nOn This Website\\nAbout Us\\nUndergraduate Programs\\nGraduate Programs\\nResearch\\nPeople\\nNews & Events\\nFull Site Map\\nInformation For\\nStudents\\nFaculty and Staff\\nAlumni\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

When the mentor doesn\\'t exist in your community, become the mentor.  Photo credit: Onion Studio\\n“Getting to know my professors helped a lot. They\\'re phenomenal. ”\\nDominique Hickson\\nComputer Engineering BS Candidate \\'17\\nPublished April 3, 2017\\nThis content is archived.\\nby Christian Miller\\nGrowing up, Dominique Hickson wished she could have met some STEM role models in her neighborhood, people who could have helped explain scientific careers and help her choose her own direction. But science professionals were largely absent from her community. \\nNevertheless, Dominique decided to become an engineer during senior year of high school at Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem, N.Y. A first-generation college student, she transferred to UB after one semester at UMass Dartmouth \"because of the low-cost in-state tuition and because UB is one of the top research institutions in the country.\"\\nAt first, Dominique struggled and found herself unprepared for some of the difficult course material. Her application to the engineering program was rejected a heartbreaking three times. But Dominique\\'s parents had taught her a quality that\\'s invaluable in situations like this: persistence. \"Anything you put your mind toward, you can accomplish it,\" she said.\\nMethodically, she strengthened her portfolio. \"I got involved. Tutoring, research opportunities, support groups, student clubs at departments around UB,\" she recalled. Soon, good things started happening. She became a student assistant in the SEAS Undergraduate Office. She won a seat on the CSE Student Advisory Board. She also won the Collegiate Science & Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) 2016 summer research program best poster award for her work on autonomous mobile robot sensors with faculty member Karthik Dantu.\\n\"Getting to know my professors helped a lot. They\\'re phenomenal,\" she said. \"The personal relationship definitely helped. I can come to them without any fear.\"\\nThe fourth try was the charm, and Dominique won admittance to the engineering program in 2015.\\nDominique will enroll in the MS program in Fall \\'17 to work with Kris Schindler in Augmentative Technology for the Handicapped.  She intends to go all the way for her PhD, ultimately planning to teach computer science in low-income neighborhoods, such as at the community centers back home in Harlem. \"I want to help at-risk students and be a role model.  I want to increase the number of African-American men and women in engineering.\"\\nShe\\'s going to take home the message, \"Hey, you can do this, too.\"\\nConnect With Us\\nComputer Science and Engineering\\n338 Davis Hall\\nBuffalo, New York 14260-2500\\n(716) 645-3180\\nQuick Links\\nWhy Choose CSE?\\nNews & Events\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nGive to CSE\\nContact Us\\nAdmissions\\nUndergraduate Admissions\\nGraduate Admissions\\nExplore Further\\nGet Involved\\nEngineering and Applied Sciences Alumni Association\\nSupport SEAS\\nCollaborate with UB\\nOn This Website\\nAbout Us\\nUndergraduate Programs\\nGraduate Programs\\nResearch\\nPeople\\nNews & Events\\nFull Site Map\\nInformation For\\nStudents\\nFaculty and Staff\\nAlumni\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

Her experience at UB was essential for preparing her for life after college and setting her up for success. \\n“The knowledge that I gained from core computer science classes such as Data Structures and Algorithms provided me with the foundation for problem-solving in software development that I still draw from every day when designing and implementing technical solutions,” Claiborne says.\\nBut the road has not always been easy. “I recently achieved a career goal of working at my dream company with an amazing team. I’m getting to do work that is fulfilling and impactful,” she says. “I set a goal of working at Google during my undergrad and did not know when or if it would even happen. It took me three tries over the span of four years to achieve it but diligence and continuous learning were the two main ingredients.”\\nKendra has recently persevered through a new challenge: beginning a new job mid-pandemic. “Since I started at YouTube in November of 2020, during what many of my peers and I term the ‘Work from Home’ period, I have not had the opportunity to go into the office or meet my team in-person as of yet,” says Claiborne. “Despite these circumstances, I\\'ve really enjoyed working on a platform that I\\'m an avid user of –and delivering technical solutions that directly impact internal business operation users’ ability to efficiently perform their roles.”\\nWe asked Kendra to reflect on her time in and out of the classroom at the University at Buffalo and share what she’s learned with aspiring engineers and computer scientists.\\nWhat’s a current project at YouTube that you’re working on that you’re excited about?\\nI\\'m currently working on a project where we\\'re implementing a notification delivery platform for internal business users in our partner management application. The notification feature will help business users to receive alerts and make actionable, timely, and intelligent decisions about their partners where historically they were unaware, delayed, or reactive when it came to events and trends that impacted their partner\\'s ability to succeed on YouTube.\\nThis project involves UI/UX and backend services, so I get to do both frontend and backend development. Given the amount of user stories associated with the project, the module is incrementally implemented which means that we release something new every two weeks, receive feedback from users and push out new and/or enhanced functionality on a bi-weekly basis.\\nWhat’s most exciting is that this is my first real project since joining the team and I’m getting the opportunity to work on this project from the ground up which allows me to have design and technical input from the beginning.\\nWhat were some formative experiences for you during your time at UB?\\nOutside of the classroom, UB offered many opportunities to build soft skills by way of networking events, interacting with recruiters and software developers from top tech companies at career fairs and company campus visits, participating in STEM research through programs like the Louis Stokes Minority Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP). \\nThe School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and student body clubs helped build my technical and non-technical skills and exposed me to communities and \"rooms\" that I normally would have been too shy to enter. One of my most memorable experiences at UB that cultivated an important purpose of mine was during my junior year when four other engineering students and I founded the student club UB Scientista, now known as UB DivTech. The organization\\'s core goals were to create more awareness around the representation of women in engineering, particularly computer science, and increase this representation through community and networking events. Being a part of this group planted the seed that has since grown into a passion of improving the representation of underrepresented groups in the tech industry.\\nWhat advice do you have for UB students who have recently graduated and will soon embark on their careers?\\nTo the rising and recent graduates, you made it to the starting line! I\\'m sure the warm-up was challenging, but it was necessary to give you the fortitude to take on your journey. There will be many paths that you can embark on throughout your journey and you may even get tripped up or take a less ideal path. Remember, mistakes are unavoidable and part of the journey, so prepare to make a ton of mistakes! When you make a mistake, how you react and your resiliency is what your peers will remember you by. Throughout my career, I\\'ve made mistakes that made me feel incompetent and doubt if I belonged. I learned that my peers did not define me and my abilities based on the mistakes I made but that how I addressed the issue is what left a lasting impression.\\nLastly, stepping out into the world, you may feel that people expect you to know everything, but that is not the case. You are an ever-evolving being and you\\'ll gain so many lessons, experience and skills over your lifetime. Be vocal in what you do know and speak up when you need time to research the unknown. You can always say \"let me get back to you on that.\" Be confident in what you do know and willing to learn.\\nDo you have any advice specifically for aspiring Black engineers?\\nTo the aspiring Black engineers, there is more than enough space in the industry for your knowledge and creativity and your input is needed, wanted and valued. I urge you to not let self-doubt or the demographic make-up of an environment dictate whether you belong or what you can accomplish. Given the current circumstances of Covid and with racial justice efforts being at the forefront of many companies\\' diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, it can feel suffocating. Take moments, as often as you need, to breathe and give yourself grace.\\nConnect With Us\\nComputer Science and Engineering\\n338 Davis Hall\\nBuffalo, New York 14260-2500\\n(716) 645-3180\\nQuick Links\\nWhy Choose CSE?\\nNews & Events\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nGive to CSE\\nContact Us\\nAdmissions\\nUndergraduate Admissions\\nGraduate Admissions\\nExplore Further\\nGet Involved\\nEngineering and Applied Sciences Alumni Association\\nSupport SEAS\\nCollaborate with UB\\nOn This Website\\nAbout Us\\nUndergraduate Programs\\nGraduate Programs\\nResearch\\nPeople\\nNews & Events\\nFull Site Map\\nInformation For\\nStudents\\nFaculty and Staff\\nAlumni\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

(That is, lecture and recitation components are not counted as separate courses towards this count.) MTH 431LR-MTH 432LR and MTH 419LR-MTH 420LR are designed for students who want intensive preparation in analysis and modern algebra, and are not good choices to just fill out a schedule. MTH 431LR-MTH 432LR may be taken as electives (in addition to MTH 417LR or MTH 418LR) or as requirements (in place of MTH 417LR and MTH 418LR).\\nStudents intending to take MTH 431LR should first take MTH 311LR to satisfy its prerequisite. In this case MTH 311LR may be used towards major elective requirements.\\nStudents who are not already proficient in Python are advised to take MTH 337LEC to prepare for MTH 448LEC. In this case, MTH 337LEC may be used towards major elective requirements.\\nTotal Credits Required for Major: 68-72\\nAdditional Degree Requirements Include:\\nAdditional coursework to fulfill UB Curriculum requirements\\nElective courses as needed to complete the 120 credit hour total\\nTotal Credits Required for Graduation: 120\\nTotal Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.\\nAcademic Requirements\\nContinuation in the major will be contingent on completing MTH 141 MTH 142 and MTH 241 (or Honors equivalent or transfer-equivalent courses), with a 2.500 GPA or higher. Students with a Calculus GPA below 2.500 may be eligible for provisional admission. Contact 716-645-8785 or math-undergrad@buffalo.edu to make an advising appointment.\\nTransfer Credit Policy\\nAll UB Mathematics majors must complete at least four upper-division mathematics courses, numbered 311-489, excluding MTH 323, MTH 326, and MTH 399, at UB. \\nProgram Honors and Program Distinction\\nMajors are eligible for Program Honors upon completion of an honors thesis under the guidance of a faculty advisor. Students typically complete MTH 499 in the fall semester and MTH 497 in the spring semester, although the timing is flexible and students may complete the thesis before their last semester. Students must also meet the remaining Program Honors criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. \\nMajors who do not pursue a thesis but have exceptional grades are eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met. These criteria are also found in the Academic Honors policy.\\nStudents who successfully complete Program Honors and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript. Program Distinction is also noted on the official transcript.\\nCurricular Plan\\nA Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time.

When you print out a new product, you can use watermarking. ”\\nZhanpeng Jin, associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering\\nUniversity at Buffalo\\nBUFFALO, N.Y. – 3D printing is transforming everything from fashion and health care to transportation and toys. But this rapidly evolving technology, also known as additive manufacturing, can threaten national security and intellectual property rights.\\nTo reduce illicit use of 3D printers, Zhanpeng Jin, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University at Buffalo, is developing a way to track the origin of 3D-printed items.\\nHis concern was that, as long as people have the digital design for an item, which can be downloaded from the internet, sometimes as open-source material, people can print out anything they want, which can range from computer parts and toys to fully functional handguns and assault rifles.\\n“So, what would be the best way to protect our intellectual property from someone else printing the same design using their own printer?” says Jin. “We wanted to find something internal. What would be the inherent signatures printed by my own 3D printer instead of another 3D printer?”\\n3D printers build three-dimensional objects by adding successive layers of printing materials according to the digital design for a 3D model. Each 3D printer has an “extruder,” which pushes the building material along. The extruder’s hot end then melts the material, and places it on the print bed to build the model.\\nIn a paper, “ThermoTag: A Hidden ID of 3D Printers for Fingerprinting and Watermarking,” published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, a research team led by Jin describes how each extruder’s hot end has its own unique heating properties, which impact the precise way that the 3D model is constructed.\\nThose thermodynamic properties can be used to identify the specific extruder and, thus, the model of 3D printer, as uniquely as a human fingerprint, or, as Jin calls it, a “ThermoTag.”\\nJin compared the process to using a laptop to write a letter. Because software exists that can track keystrokes, an observer can see every step that went into the letter, including the writer’s unique writing style. Similarly, because of the unique properties of each 3D printer’s extruder, a researcher can examine the specific manner in which a 3D-printed object was made, and compare that to a database of various extruders until a match is made. From there, once the model printer is identified, the purchaser of said model can be tracked down if they had, say, used the printer to build an illegal assault rifle.\\nAccording to the research, Jin and his team discovered that, by examining and comparing the ThermoTag features of 45 different extruders of the same model, they were able to correctly identify the source printer with an accuracy rate of 92%.\\n“This ThermoTag will behave like the fingerprint of the 3D printer. When you print out a new product, you can use watermarking,” Jin says, noting that watermarking can be used to invisibly embed such information as the printer’s manufacturer, label and serial number in the product. “So that would make this watermark of this particular product unique.”\\nIt’s possible, Jin says, that someone could replace their extruder to try to avoid detection. That’s why it’s important to create a database of these parts for comparison, he says.\\nCo-authors of the study are UB faculty members Chi Zhou, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, and Wenyao Xu, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. The lead student author is Yang Gao, and additional student co-authors include Wei Wang and Yincheng Jin, all graduate students in Jin’s lab.\\nMedia Contact Information\\nMedia Relations (University Communications)\\n330 Crofts Hall (North Campus)\\nBuffalo, NY 14260-7015\\nTel: 716-645-6969\\nub-news@buffalo.edu\\nUB is actively monitoring developments related to COVID-19.

Recognizing the applicability of computing to all fields of knowledge and practice, the Department will provide a variety of degrees and programs at each of the degree levels, and will cooperate with other units of the University to provide interdisciplinary degree programs.\\nStudent Education\\nWe provide state-of-the-art education and training in the use of computers to UB students regardless of their majors.\\nThe Department's mission includes providing state-of-the-art computer education and training to all students at UB to bring them to the level of knowledge and ability required by their major. This includes bringing all UB students to a basic level of computing skills which all instructors may expect all their students to have, and other students to the level required by their majors, so that all instructors may expect their students to be able to use computers appropriately in their coursework. The computer, communications, and information industries are experiencing an intense shortage of appropriately trained employees. Many of these jobs are appropriate for students with majors not in the discipline of computing, but with a knowledge of computing beyond the minimal required by their own majors. The CSE Department's mission includes providing appropriate computer education to prepare students throughout UB for employment in the information technology workforce.\\nDepartmental Assistance\\nWe assist other UB departments in developing faculty computing expertise appropriate to their programs.\\nThe Department's mission includes supporting other UB departments to attract faculty with computing expertise appropriate to their programs, and to further develop the computing expertise of current faculty. Such support could include assistance with recruiting, offers of joint and adjunct appointments, and development of shared and collaborative research efforts and programs.\\nIndustrial Outreach\\nWe are a source of computing expertise to UB, Western New York, and New York State.\\nThe Department's mission includes industrial outreach and other methods of sharing its expertise with the University, the Region, and the State, as is appropriate for a department in a State University.\\nConnect With Us\\nComputer Science and Engineering\\n338 Davis Hall\\nBuffalo, New York 14260-2500\\n(716) 645-3180\\nQuick Links\\nWhy Choose CSE?\\nNews & Events\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nGive to CSE\\nContact Us\\nAdmissions\\nUndergraduate Admissions\\nGraduate Admissions\\nExplore Further\\nGet Involved\\nEngineering and Applied Sciences Alumni Association\\nSupport SEAS\\nCollaborate with UB\\nOn This Website\\nAbout Us\\nUndergraduate Programs\\nGraduate Programs\\nResearch\\nPeople\\nNews & Events\\nFull Site Map\\nInformation For\\nStudents\\nFaculty and Staff\\nAlumni\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

Until then, I’d been immersed in the logistical weeds of the Playbook. But that moment made me realize that we have created something that could potentially be great. ”\\nAtri Rudra, professor of computer science and engineering\\nUniversity at Buffalo\\nBUFFALO, N.Y. — The University at Buffalo is among 22 colleges and universities to create a guide on how schools can update curricula to place more emphasis on ethics when designing technology products.\\nThe Teaching Responsible Computing Playbook collected contributions from more than 30 authors from a range of institutions — liberal arts, private and public, community college, Ivy League, Jesuit, Quaker and more.\\nEach institution created undergraduate computing curricula that address the social impact of computing. Ultimately, the goal is to assist higher education institutions integrate responsibility and ethics into their computing curricula and drive a cultural shift in the tech industry to help build a healthier internet.\\n“My main feeling about the Playbook is a sense of wonder about what we as a group were able to achieve,” said Playbook co-editor Atri Rudra, PhD, a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at UB.\\nHe added: “Earlier this year I was talking with a new colleague who is interested in responsible computing in education, and they listed five or six things that they thought were important to consider. I realized we had a section for each of those topics. Until then, I’d been immersed in the logistical weeds of the Playbook. But that moment made me realize that we have created something that could potentially be great.”\\nComputer scientist Kathy Pham, a Mozilla Fellow and co-editor of the Playbook, said the Playbook has tremendous potential to reach computer science and engineering students.\\n“The code they write may be used by billions of people, influencing everything from which news stories we read, to what kind of personal data companies collect, to who qualifies for parole, insurance, or housing loans — and who does not,” said Pham. “In other words, these students have the power to shape society. When that power isn’t coupled with responsibility, the results can have unintended consequences, negatively impacting users’ autonomy, privacy, security, or wellbeing, as well as causing harm to society as a whole.” \\nEach section contains an overview; key questions for educators to ask themselves; step-by-step checklists; case studies of how participating institutions have integrated those checklists into their programs; and links to additional resources.\\nMatthew Hertz, PhD, associate professor of teaching in CSE, co-authored the section “Accreditation and Ethics” (along with Rudra). Kenneth Joseph, PhD, assistant professor, and Jennifer Winikus, PhD, assistant professor of teaching, both in CSE, also contributed as this list of authors and contributors shows. Rudra also wrote two other sections on “Choosing Computing Courses” and “Access to Technology.”\\nMozilla and the schools are encouraging faculty from additional institutions, especially those outside the United States, to add to the work though the Playbook submission form.\\nThe Playbook is a collection of learnings and best practices gleaned from the first two years of a three-year Responsible Computer Science Challenge initiative led by the Mozilla Foundation, Omidyar Network, Schmidt Futures, and Craig Newmark Philanthropies. The initiative provided $3.5 million in grants to 19 colleges and universities to conceptualize, develop, and pilot curricula that integrate ethics with undergraduate computer science training. \\nMedia Contact Information\\nCory Nealon\\nDirector of News Content\\nEngineering, Computer Science\\nTel: 716-645-4614\\ncmnealon@buffalo.edu\\nUB is actively monitoring developments related to COVID-19.

Interdisciplinary Areas program national ranking, 2019-2022. Source: csrankings.org\\nInterdisciplinary research category introduction and description.\\nComputational Biology and Bioinformatics\\nFocuses on developing highly efficient algorithms and techniques for a wide range of problems (such as automatic analysis of biomedical images, computer-assisted diagnosis, treatment planning, protein-protein interaction network analysis, protein structure prediction, computational analysis and interpretation of Genomes, evolutionary studies of Genomic ORFans, and spatial positioning patterns of the cell nucleus) arising in smart hospital, smart healthcare, precision medicine, genomics, proteomics, and microarray analysis.\\nComputing Education\\nFocuses on expanding approaches to teaching computing at all levels (K-12 and University) and the outreach to promote computing majors and careers.\\nHuman-Computer Interaction\\nHuman-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design of computer technology, in particular, the interaction between humans (the users) and computers. HCI researchers observe the ways humans interact with computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact with computers in novel ways.\\nSociety and Computing\\nComputing is ubiquitous in society today. Computing touches all aspects of our lives and sometimes in ways that are not beneficial (even though the intent of the developer is not to cause harm). What has become clear is that we cannot develop systems for society without meaningful and deep collaborations with disciplines that have thought about society for much longer than computing. The challenge is to incorporate knowledge from humanistic studies from day one in the design of computing systems.\\nRESEARCH RANKING\\nExcelsior!\\nUB's institutional reputation in the field of computer science has improved dramatically over the last decade.  By the most valid measure, our national ranking has risen from 50th to 29th.\\nRESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS\\nThis Necklace Hears What You Eat\\nWenyao Xu created AutoDietary—software that tracks the unique sounds produced by food as people chew it.  AutoDietary, placed near the throat by a necklace delivery system developed at China's Northeastern University, helps users measure their caloric intake.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMORE RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS\\nRECOGNITIONS\\nXu, Moore receive SUNY Chancellor’s Awards\\nAwards acknowledge and provide system-wide recognition for consistently superior professional achievement and the ongoing pursuit of excellence.\\n\\nMORE RECOGNITIONS\\nConnect With Us\\nComputer Science and Engineering\\n338 Davis Hall\\nBuffalo, New York 14260-2500\\n(716) 645-3180\\nQuick Links\\nWhy Choose CSE?\\nNews & Events\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nGive to CSE\\nContact Us\\nAdmissions\\nUndergraduate Admissions\\nGraduate Admissions\\nExplore Further\\nGet Involved\\nEngineering and Applied Sciences Alumni Association\\nSupport SEAS\\nCollaborate with UB\\nOn This Website\\nAbout Us\\nUndergraduate Programs\\nGraduate Programs\\nResearch\\nPeople\\nNews & Events\\nFull Site Map\\nInformation For\\nStudents\\nFaculty and Staff\\nAlumni\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

All courses taken by a student that are included in the Legal Studies curriculum will be used in calculation of the major GPA. For example, if a curriculum requires a student to select two courses from a particular section and the student completes three courses from that section, all three courses would be used to calculate a student’s major GPA. The Legal Studies major may not be combined with any other major to form a joint major.  Students pursuing a double major may use a maximum of two advanced (300 or 400 level) courses towards both majors. For example a student completing a double major between Legal Studies and sociology may take only two advanced level sociology courses for completion of the Legal Studies major.\\nFor students not continuously registered at UB or who are newly admitted transfer students, courses taken more than 10 years prior to the date of admission or readmission to the University may constitute no more than 20% of a major program in the Legal Studies major.\\nTransfer Credit Policy\\nAt least 50 percent of coursework toward the major must be completed at UB. Courses taken more than 10 years prior to the date of admission to the University may constitute no more than 20% of a major program in the Legal Studies major.\\nProgram Distinction\\nA student in this major is eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met. Criteria are found under Academic Honors in the Policy and Procedure section of this Catalog. Program Distinction is noted on the official transcript.\\nCurricular Plan\\nA Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time.

I can bring up and manage a whole network infrastructure. ”\\nJames Droste\\nComputer Science BS Candidate \\'17\\nPublished April 3, 2017\\nThis content is archived.\\nby Christian Miller\\nJames Droste wears a black UB Network Defense jacket with his hacker code name, debug, embroidered on the sleeve. It\\'s a sleek look for the captain of the UB team that competed in the 2016 Northeast Collegiate Cyberdefense Competition, hosted at RIT, at which UB took third place.\\n\"The entire weekend was designed to make us sweat the entire time,\" James recalled. \"Constantly being attacked, trying to get stuff done. It\\'s meant to be a very high pressure situation to say the least. We typically don\\'t sleep, up \\'til 3 a.m., back up at 9 a.m. It\\'s fun when they rm -rf a box. They reweaponized a virus called Shamoon. They put it on all our boxes so it would turn our boxes off. It triggered an alert, and because it was the same virus, we thought the real virus was back. General antics from the red team.\"\\nThe red team is the offensive squad that challenges the cyberdefenders, made up of industry professionals who perform penetration testing for a living. They work for government agencies and private security contractors. \"This is the only time they can let loose and not care if things work or not after they leave,\" James said. \"They\\'re people heavy inside the information security community.\"\\nJames, from Nanuet, NY, got started in cyberdefense when he met former CSE sysadmin Kevin Cleary. \"When I was interviewing to be a CSE 101 teaching assistant, Kevin was one of my interviewers. I\\'m amazed by the stuff I was able to do in Davis 339C, CSE\\'s student server room. That\\'s my second home.  I can bring up and manage a whole network infrastructure. That\\'s something I never thought I\\'d be able to do.\"\\nJames will join the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Security Operations Team in Seattle, WA, after he graduates in May. \"When you email aws-security, we\\'re the team that handles that,\" he said. \"If one of your EC2 instances got hacked, we\\'re your team.\" He interned at Amazon\\'s Herndon, Va. location between his junior and senior years.  Because AWS runs such a high percentage of commercial websites, \"I actually got to protect the Internet.\"\\nHe looks forward to living in Seattle. \"Everything\\'s walkable and I\\'ll be in the city, so it\\'s pretty sick. Our floor was awesome. It\\'s so high up, the view is incredible. They allow dogs in the workplace, so we have two dogs on the team, too.\"\\nJames doesn\\'t rule out joining the real-life red team at some point in the future. \"I see it as my military service.  I could do that to give back to the country.\"\\nConnect With Us\\nComputer Science and Engineering\\n338 Davis Hall\\nBuffalo, New York 14260-2500\\n(716) 645-3180\\nQuick Links\\nWhy Choose CSE?\\nNews & Events\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nGive to CSE\\nContact Us\\nAdmissions\\nUndergraduate Admissions\\nGraduate Admissions\\nExplore Further\\nGet Involved\\nEngineering and Applied Sciences Alumni Association\\nSupport SEAS\\nCollaborate with UB\\nOn This Website\\nAbout Us\\nUndergraduate Programs\\nGraduate Programs\\nResearch\\nPeople\\nNews & Events\\nFull Site Map\\nInformation For\\nStudents\\nFaculty and Staff\\nAlumni\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

Don’t worry-you can create your own. (Yes, really!) The special studies program is the perfect choice if you want everything UB has to offer, but we don’t have your exact major, or maybe you want to combine different areas. It’s not for everyone-but that’s the point. If you’re resourceful, determined and enjoy making your own path, then take a closer look at what special studies offers. \\nVisit the Special Studies academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.\\n  Overview\\nThe Special Studies degree program at UB enables students to design a unique academic path to an undergraduate degree. Students create an individualized academic major, from the vast curricular and faculty resources available at UB, which reflects a student’s unique academic interests and aspirations. Special Studies majors are purposeful, coherent programs of study, sponsored and approved by the faculty, and allow students to achieve individualized academic goals.\\nStudents must have a 2.5 minimum GPA to propose a Special Studies major. Students develop a special major proposal that includes support from two faculty sponsors.  The proposal is then reviewed and approved by a faculty committee and the Dean of Undergraduate Education. A well-constructed proposal clearly outlines the rationale for the special major, shows a deliberately formulated plan of study that defines and reflects the student’s educational objectives at UB.\\nCourse Requirements\\nCourse requirements are determined based on the Special Studies major proposal, developed by the student and their faculty sponsors and approved by a faculty committee and the Dean of Undergraduate Education. The curriculum should lead to mastery of the area of knowledge described in the program description. Coursework should provide both breadth and depth in the area of knowledge being pursued. Most Special Studies majors contain between 32 and 50 credits of requirements drawn from across university offerings.\\nThe special major may not duplicate any existing degree program in the university. Special majors cannot be used to propose academic concentrations similar to existing university programs with the intention of circumventing specific requirements.\\nApproval of a special major does not guarantee access to courses from departments that limit their enrollments to majors only. It is the student’s responsibility to negotiate with the respective departments for those restricted courses which are integral to the proposed major concentration.\\nSpecial majors cannot be proposed in areas where certification or licensure is required by state or professional boards of accreditation (e.g., nursing, engineering). Special majors may also not suggest that the student is acquiring professional competence as a therapist (programs titled Art Therapy, Psychotherapy, etc. are prohibited).\\nIn addition to the requirements set forth in the Special Students major proposal, all university degree requirements must be met, including (but not limited to):\\nMinimum of 120 and maximum of 126 total credits.\\nResidency requirement of 30 credits.\\nAll UB Curriculum (general education) requirements completed.\\nAt least 45 credit hours at the upper division (at least 300-level), including at least 24 credits within the Special Studies major.\\nB.S. degrees require 60 Liberal Arts and Sciences credits. The Liberal Arts and Sciences comprise the disciplines of the humanities, natural sciences and mathematics, and social sciences. \\nTotal Credits Required for Graduation: 120-126\\nTotal Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.\\nAcademic Requirements\\nStudents must have a minimum overall GPA of 2.5, at the time of application. A minimum 2.00 GPA in both the major and the overall academic record is required for graduation.\\nThe Special Studies proposal consists of the following:\\nDegree title: The title should reflect the purpose and content of the major.\\nProgram description: This describes the academic purpose of the special major, including a description of the area of knowledge to be mastered through the special major.\\nProgram Learning Objectives: Statements describing what the student will know and be able to do as a result of completing the degree requirements.\\nList of specific courses and curriculum requirements. The curriculum should lead to mastery of the area of knowledge described in the program description. Coursework should provide both breadth and depth in the area of knowledge being pursued. Most Special Studies majors contain between 32 and 50 credits of requirements drawn from across university offerings.\\nA Curriculum Map showing the connection between the required courses and the Program Learning Objectives.\\nA curricular plan outlining the specific courses (both major and degree requirements) to be taken across 8 semesters.\\nLetters of support from two faculty sponsors.\\nAny tutorial work (496, 498 or 499) should be briefly described indicating the sponsor of the activity, the faculty person who is responsible for grading, and the process of evaluation for the tutorial work. Letters of support should be included from any external site sponsors (i.e., for internships or similar field placements). Independent study courses must be described and approved using the standard independent study form. Study abroad programs and courses should be specifically identified and described.\\nAll major courses transferred to UB from other schools must be formally designated and identified. Transfer courses may comprise no more than 50% of the major curriculum.\\nLearning Outcomes\\nEach special major is unique. Therefore, the learning outcomes will differ by program.\\nReturn to: Majors and Combined Degrees\\n\\na\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

Seniors with a GPA of at least 3.000 overall and in psychology courses who have secured a faculty advisor to supervise their work are eligible. Prior or concurrent completion of PSY 450 is required. PSY 300 and PSY 498  are strongly recommended. Students take PSY 497 fall semester and write an Honors Thesis throughout the fall and spring semesters. Students defend their thesis in an oral examination at the end of the spring semester. Students must also meet the remaining Program Honors criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. \\nMajors who do not pursue a thesis but have exceptional grades are eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met.  These criteria are also found in the Academic Honors policy.\\nCurricular Plan\\nA Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time.

From personal uncertainty to a best graduate research award.  Photo credit: Onion Studio\\n“Research is a change process. From being scared at first to being interested in it. ”\\nAosen Wang\\nPhD Candidate \\'19\\nPublished April 4, 2017\\nThis content is archived.\\nby Christian Miller\\nAosen Wang\\'s first job was as an algorithm software engineer at Vimicro, a multimedia chip design firm not far from his hometown of Siping, in China\\'s Ji Lin Province.  His job was strictly on the software side, tweaking code to improve chip efficiency.  It was a perfectly respectable start for the career of a graduate of the prestigious University of Science and Technology of China.  But Aosen suspected that greater victories were within reach.\\n\"I realized that not so much could be improved at the software level,\" he said.  \"I wanted to get into the lower hardware layers where big performance improvements could be made.\"  Time delays could be foreshortened.  Accuracy improved.  He wanted to contribute his own innovative ideas to the field.  For that, he came to Buffalo.\\nBut, having arrived at UB, he discovered that the freedom to chart his own research course was unexpectedly daunting.  \"I was scared before coming here,\" he said.  \"Research is difficult, cutting-edge.  Maybe I don\\'t have answers.\"\\nThings improved when he found a kindred spirit in faculty advisor Wenyao Xu, who shares his interest in low power computer architecture design.  \"The most important thing has been help from my advisor,\" said Aosen. \"At our first meeting, he told me not to worry. He taught me how to do the research, the discussion, the background, which parts to pay attention to, and how to optimize the results.\"\\nWith Dr. Xu\\'s help, Aosen found his groove.  \"I published my first paper after my first semester.\"  By his second year, he won the 2016 CSE Best Graduate Research Award.  \"I find it\\'s not so difficult.  Research is a change process. From being scared to being interested in it.  Students and faculty are willing to help, just like family.  I can ask silly questions.  Algorithms and machine learning techniques.  At first, I feel the research is very difficult, but now I feel this is a very good topic.  I keep asking my advisor to let me work on more ideas.\"\\nConnect With Us\\nComputer Science and Engineering\\n338 Davis Hall\\nBuffalo, New York 14260-2500\\n(716) 645-3180\\nQuick Links\\nWhy Choose CSE?\\nNews & Events\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nGive to CSE\\nContact Us\\nAdmissions\\nUndergraduate Admissions\\nGraduate Admissions\\nExplore Further\\nGet Involved\\nEngineering and Applied Sciences Alumni Association\\nSupport SEAS\\nCollaborate with UB\\nOn This Website\\nAbout Us\\nUndergraduate Programs\\nGraduate Programs\\nResearch\\nPeople\\nNews & Events\\nFull Site Map\\nInformation For\\nStudents\\nFaculty and Staff\\nAlumni\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

Photo Illustration: Douglas Levere\\nBy Nicole Capozziello\\nPublished July 12, 2021\\nLast November, a team from the University at Buffalo entered the highly competitive Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge.  \\nShare This\\nPrint\\n“Regardless of the final outcome, it has been a valuable experience, allowing us to learn about user behavior during conversations, as well as what it takes to effectively leverage neural text generators. I’m also grateful to have had a multidisciplinary team consisting of computer scientists and linguists and the complementary expertise they bring. This is a strength, and has compensated for us having a relatively small team compared to our competitors.”\\nRohini Srihari, professor and associate chair\\nDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering\\nWhile the multimillion-dollar competition is in its fourth year, this was the first time UB had participated in the challenge of creating a socialbot “that can converse coherently and engagingly for 20 minutes with humans on a range of current events and popular topics such as entertainment, sports, politics, technology and fashion.”\\nThe members of Team Proto, Sougata Saha and Souvik Das, PhD students in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and Elizabeth Soper and Erin Pacquetet, PhD students in the Department of Linguistics, were happy to have the opportunity, not knowing how far they would go in a pool with other esteemed colleagues from around the globe.\\nSince then, the team, under the direction of Rohini Srihari, professor and associate chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, has drawn on their complementary skills and knowledge throughout the progressive months and levels of the competition. Thus far, the team’s socialbot has been judged by people everywhere, including over 55,000 users during the semifinal phase alone.\\nNow, nearly a year after their original application was accepted, the team has become one of only five to advance to the finals stage of the competition. They are competing against the University of California Santa Cruz, Czech Technical University (Prague), Stanford University and Emory University. Stanford and Emory are both previous winners of the competition.\\nThe finals will be conducted over a three-day period later this month. During this time, the socialbots will be evaluated by a panel of experts. While this phase does not specifically stipulate any additional features, the team has been hard at work on some overall enhancements that they think will be help distinguish their socialbot from the others. These include innovations regarding their socialbot’s ability to converse on any topic, the “naturalness” of conversation and reacting to various user behaviors that they have observed throughout testing.\\nThe winning team, which will receive a prize of $500,000, will be announced by the end of July.\\n“Regardless of the final outcome, it has been a valuable experience, allowing us to learn about user behavior during conversations, as well as what it takes to effectively leverage neural text generators,” says Srihari. “I’m also grateful to have had a multidisciplinary team consisting of computer scientists and linguists and the complementary expertise they bring. This is a strength, and has compensated for us having a relatively small team compared to our competitors.”\\nWe caught up with Srihari to hear all about where the team is now – and where they hope their work will lead them.\\nWhat has the team learned as this competition has gone on?\\nOur learning has been in two areas. First, we have learned a lot about how users react to conversational AI systems: what gets them excited and wanting to continue a conversation, what they find less interesting, and what spooks them out. Second, on the technology side, we have learned a lot about effectively leveraging the latest deep learning technology, in particular, neural text generation. We have also learned about the ebb and flow of a conversation and how to algorithmically control this, for example, when to let the user steer the conversation. When we first started, most of our socialbot utterances were generated through knowledge engineering approaches, based on deep domain knowledge of how people converse about topics such as movies or games. Only a small fraction of the Proto utterances were generated through the neural text generation models. Now the situation has flipped, with most of the utterances being generated through neural models. This allows us to converse on a far wider range of topics.\\nWhat impact do you hope that your work in this field will have?\\nConversational AI systems are in a nascent stage. Currently we are focused on just the ability to conduct human-like conversations. However, these socialbots have tremendous potential for societal impact. We are particularly interested in conducting purposeful conversations, for example, encouraging people to pursue health-related goals, and of course, in helping to combat disinformation.\\nIs there anything people misunderstand about AI that you would like them to know?\\nPerhaps the fear that AI systems can think and learn completely on their own and thus become harmful to individuals and society. AI systems perform based on (i) the models that scientists design to implement the solutions, and perhaps even more important, (ii) the data that the systems are trained on. Currently, socialbots are limited in their abilities due to the lack of representative training data sets. It’s hard for socialbots to narrate anecdotes about personal experiences, or express emotions. We have a long way to go.\\nIs there anything the UB community can do to support the team at this phase of the competition?\\nIdeally, we would have liked the UB community to help us test out the socialbot.

Keeping his option open to pivot into academia or industry.  Photo credit: Onion Studio\\n“Here, there are different career opportunities, and good opportunities in industry as well. ”\\nLuigi Di Tacchio\\nPhD Candidate \\'18\\nPublished April 4, 2017\\nThis content is archived.\\nby Christian Miller\\nLuigi Di Tacchio is CSE\\'s first Italian PhD student (from Rome). But he may be at the forefront of a wave; he\\'s subsequently been joined by Gian Pietro Farina (PhD candidate, from Perugia) and Marco Gaboardi (assistant professor).\\nLuigi first came to UB as an exchange student from La Sapienza, the famous \"University of Rome.\" \"I wanted to enjoy the experience and gain some skills in academia or industry,\" Luigi said. \"I like the idea of doing something new, it\\'s like a challenge.\"\\nHis first night in Buffalo certainly qualified as that. He arrived in the middle of the night, in a snowstorm (\"I never experienced snow before in my life\"), and without a room. \"I felt really lost and didn\\'t know where to go,\" he said. Eventually, a helpful Campus Living staffer put him up in the Governors Complex for the night. \\nMore cultural challenges followed: speaking the language, getting a credit card (Italians typically use cash and debit cards, but not credit cards), where to eat, where to buy groceries. Despite these troublesome logistics, there was one compelling reason that made the transcontinental move worthwhile.\\n\"We really don\\'t do research so much in Italy,\" Luigi explains. \"When we\\'re undergrads, we don\\'t do research at all. In Italy, the PhD is associated with academia. Only if you want to become a professor do you get a PhD. Here, there are different career opportunities, and good opportunities in industry as well.\"\\n\"He is a great PhD student in all aspects,\" said Tevfik Kosar, Luigi\\'s advisor. \"Perfect GPA, excellent research, and sought-after TA.\"\\nLuigi\\'s PhD topic is energy efficiency in cloud computing. He became interested in this area while writing his MS thesis on energy efficiency in filesystems. \"It\\'s a natural progression,\" he said. \"I can reuse some of the knowledge I\\'ve gained in the last few years. This is a topic that has a future, a relatively new topic. Filesystems are implemented mostly at the software level, and energy improvements are made by accesses of data location. Efficiency at cloud can be done at the hardware level and at software-level scheduling. We can redirect accesses at the data level to put some hardware to sleep or in energy-saving mode.\"\\nHe\\'s also cultivated a reputation as a masterful teacher. In 2016, he won the CSE Best Graduate Teaching Award for his work in CSE 115/116: Intro to Programming, CSE 421/521: Operating Systems, and CSE 487/587: Data Intensive Computing. \"Having to deal with different people with different attitudes is an invaluable skill,\" he said. \"Talented students and also the students just trying to get the project done in office hours, they try to take shortcuts.\"\\nAnd as a volunteer graduate student ambassador, Luigi helps incoming grad students transition to life at UB. He works to make their welcomes to campus warmer than his first confusing, snowy night here.\\n\"I don\\'t know if I\\'ll try academia or industry,\" Luigi said. \"I\\'ve already taught, but maybe I\\'d like to have an internship and try industry.\"  Both great options to start an already promising career.\\nConnect With Us\\nComputer Science and Engineering\\n338 Davis Hall\\nBuffalo, New York 14260-2500\\n(716) 645-3180\\nQuick Links\\nWhy Choose CSE?\\nNews & Events\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nGive to CSE\\nContact Us\\nAdmissions\\nUndergraduate Admissions\\nGraduate Admissions\\nExplore Further\\nGet Involved\\nEngineering and Applied Sciences Alumni Association\\nSupport SEAS\\nCollaborate with UB\\nOn This Website\\nAbout Us\\nUndergraduate Programs\\nGraduate Programs\\nResearch\\nPeople\\nNews & Events\\nFull Site Map\\nInformation For\\nStudents\\nFaculty and Staff\\nAlumni\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

Venu Govindaraju (far right) served as moderator. Photo: Meredith Forrest Kulwicki\\nBy LAURIE KAISER\\nPublished September 8, 2023\\nShare This\\nPrint\\n“The University at Buffalo is a groundbreaker in the field. ”\\nSUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr.\\nArtificial intelligence is much more than ChatGPT. It’s a tool that can help professionals — from scientists and teachers to physicians and farmers — make data-informed decisions to address society’s most pressing challenges.\\nUB stands at the forefront of AI research and exploration. This was evident during the Sept. 6 launch of a panel discussion series called UB | AI Chat Series, “Harnessing AI for Public Good.”\\nSUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr. joined President Satish K. Tripathi in Capen Hall to kick off the series that features faculty members from a variety of disciplines who are developing ways to use AI for the betterment of society. Approximately 60 audience members from the UB community attended.\\n“The University at Buffalo is a groundbreaker in the field,” said King, who noted that UB recently received $20 million from the National Science Foundation to fund its new National AI Institute for Exceptional Education.\\nThe institute, which is designed to ensure that children with speech and language disorders do not fall behind academically, is among several cutting-edge AI initiatives at UB. Others include the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and the Center for Information Integrity.\\n“Today we’re here to discuss an area of interdisciplinary strength that has implications for every aspect of our life — from our homes and health to education, transportation, communication, national security and much more,” Tripathi said. “I’m speaking, of course, about artificial intelligence.”\\nVenu Govindaraju, vice president for research and economic development and SUNY Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, moderated the discussion with four faculty members.\\nThe panel discussion launched the new series UB | AI Chat Series, \"Harnessing AI for the Public Good. Photos: Douglas Levere and Meredith Forrest Kulwicki\\nFirst, he laid out a timeline of AI’s influence and highlighted UB’s decades-long leadership in the field, including work in the 1990s when Govindaraju — along with a team of faculty, staff and students — led a project that developed a machine-learning system for postal mail, saving the U.S. Postal Service millions of dollars.\\nIn the ensuing decades, AI has been harnessed to make robots that simulate human emotions, social media algorithms that measure user experience and virtual assistants that can provide seemingly infinite amounts of information.\\n“The volume and complexity of data is too vast for humans to process,” Govindaraju said. “What computers can process in one second would take 36 billion years for humans.”[CN1]\\nOver the next hour, he directed questions to the panel members who have studied AI from a variety of viewpoints:\\nCiprian “Chip” Ionita, assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, which is a joint program of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.\\nChristine Wang, professor in the Department of Learning and Instruction and director of the Fisher-Price-Endowed Early Childhood Research Center in the Graduate School of Education.\\nIfeoma Nwogu, associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and co-director of graduate studies in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.\\nDavid Castillo, professor in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, College of Arts and Sciences, and co-director of the Center for Information Integrity.\\nGovindaraju asked questions about everything from what AI means to them to its potential to benefit and improve specific industries and services.\\nIonita noted that AI can help stroke victims communicate and guide surgeons in predicting patient outcomes based on information discovered during procedures. And in the near future, he said, wearable devices will help detect chronic diseases earlier and save lives.\\n“AI continues to make progress in medicine,” Ionita said. “The key is to make it transparent for physicians and explainable to the public.”\\nWang said AI can aid K-12 classroom teaching, including personalized learning for students with a range of learning styles and abilities, as well as augmented reality that allows teachers to do things like take students on virtual field trips.\\nAt the same time, Wang emphasized the importance of instilling soft skills in students so that they will be good communicators and patient with those with differing viewpoints.\\n“We have to think critically about how AI impacts our lives,” Wang said. “What are the ethical concerns? What will be the most effective and equitable for young learners?” \\nThe talk Wednesday marks the beginning of a two-year series that will highlight how UB researchers from across academic disciplines are using AI to improve society.\\nChancellor John B. King meets with UB deans (left) and students at UB\\'s Blackstone LaunchPad. Photos: Douglas Levere and Meredith Forrest Kulwicki\\nKing noted the important role that faculty members play in helping to understand a changing world.\\n“In such times educators and researchers must be beacons of insight and morality, of common sense and uncommon insight, of explanation and observation, and of, more than anything else, a reverence for knowledge, a desire to advance understanding, and a wish that all which we discover will better the lives of our planet’s inhabitants,” King said.\\nPrior to the panel discussion, King met with students who are participating in Blackstone LaunchPad, an experiential campus program designed to introduce entrepreneurship as a viable career path. \\n“It was exciting to hear from the students and see their energy,” King said. “Blackstone provides opportunities for internships, mentoring and academic learning in a real-world environment.”\\nUB is actively monitoring developments related to COVID-19.

Photo: Douglas Levere\\nBy CORY NEALON\\nPublished January 9, 2023\\nShare This\\nPrint\\n“Being chosen by the National Science Foundation to lead this impactful initiative underscores the pivotal role our world-class researchers play in addressing society’s most pressing challenges, including cultivating just and inclusive environ-ments that enable young learners to flourish. ”\\nPresident Satish K. Tripathi\\nUB has been awarded a highly competitive grant by the National Science Foundation to establish a national institute to develop artificial intelligence systems that identify and assist young children with speech and/or language processing challenges.\\nThe five-year, $20 million effort will address the nationwide shortage of speech-language pathologists and provide services to children ages 3 to 10 who are at increased risk of falling behind in their academic and socioemotional development — issues exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nThe award, which UB will use to create the AI Institute for Exceptional Education, also will advance foundational AI technologies, human-centered AI design, and learning science that improve educational outcomes for young children. It is one of the largest federal research grants received by UB, New York’s flagship university.\\n“The University at Buffalo is deeply committed to harnessing our research and educational excellence for the greater good, and our faculty have long been pioneers in the development of cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems,” said President Satish K. Tripathi. “Being chosen by the National Science Foundation to lead this impactful initiative underscores the pivotal role our world-class researchers play in addressing society’s most pressing challenges, including cultivating just and inclusive environments that enable young learners to flourish.”\\nVenu Govindaraju, vice president for research and economic development, is the grant’s principal investigator.\\n“There simply aren’t enough speech-language pathologists in the United States and, as a result, children are not receiving life-changing interventions soon enough,” said Govindaraju, SUNY Distinguished Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. “Our multidisciplinary team will create advanced artificial intelligence systems that address this critical problem, allowing for earlier diagnoses and tailored interventions that close educational gaps and create more inclusive learning environments where children thrive both academically and socially.”\\nThe AI Screener will collect samples of children’s speech, facial expressions, gestures and other data, creating weekly summaries of these interactions. These summaries will help teachers monitor their students’ speech and language processing abilities and, if needed, suggest a formal evaluation with a speech-language pathologist.\\nInstitute will help underserved students\\nThe AI Institute for Exceptional Education will focus on serving the millions of children nationwide who, under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, require speech and language services.\\nSpecially, it will develop two advanced AI solutions: the AI Screener for early identification of potential speech and/or language impairments and disorders, and the AI Orchestrator, which will act as a virtual teaching assistant by providing students with ability-based interventions.\\nThe AI Screener will listen to and observe children in the classroom, collecting samples of children’s speech, facial expressions, gestures and other data. It will create weekly summaries of these interactions that catalogue each child’s vocabulary, pronunciation, video snippets and more. These summaries will help teachers monitor their students’ speech and language processing abilities and, if needed, suggest a formal evaluation with a speech-language pathologist.\\nThis is critical because, typically, the earlier speech and language concerns are addressed, the greater the likelihood children will excel academically and socioemotionally.\\nThe AI Orchestrator is an app that will help speech-language pathologists, most of whom have average caseloads so large that they are forced to provide group-based interventions for children instead of individualized care. The app addresses this by recommending personalized content tailored to students’ needs. It continues to monitor students’ progress and adjusts lesson plans to ensure that the interventions are working.\\nThe research team will ensure that data collected by the AI Screener and the AI Orchestrator adheres to ethics and privacy guidelines. Information about these plans will be shared with participants. Initially, the team intends to deploy prototypes of each system to roughly 80 classrooms, reaching 480 kindergartners. \\nInstitute comprised of top research universities\\nThe institute will consist of more than 30 researchers from nine universities including UB; the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Stanford University; the University of Washington; Cornell University; the University of Nevada, Reno; the University of Texas at El Paso; Penn State University; and the University of Oregon.\\nThese scholars specialize in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, social robotics, communicative disorders, diversity and inclusivity, learning science, communication and other fields.\\nGovindaraju and UB researchers Jinjun Xiong and Srirangaraj Setlur will coordinate the team’s work.\\nXiong, an Empire Innovation Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, is a co-principal investigator, and will serve as the institute’s scientific director and co-director. Setlur, a principal research scientist in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, will serve as the institute’s managing director.\\nAdditional co-principal investigators include David Feil-Seifer, associate professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at University of Nevada, Reno; Pamela Hadley, professor and department head of the Department of Speech and Hearing Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; and Julie Kientz, professor and chair of the Department of Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University of Washington.\\nIn addition to Govindaraju, Xiong and Setlur, the institute will include 13 UB researchers representing the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Graduate School of Education.\\nLetitia Thomas, assistant dean for diversity in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, will lead the broadening participation and diversity, equity and inclusion sections of the grant.\\nX. Christine Wang, associate dean for research at the Graduate School of Education and director of the Fisher-Price Endowed Early Childhood Research Center at UB, will lead the education and workforce development section of the research and assist the field testing. \\n“The educational tools that this interdisciplinary team of researchers will create has the potential to have a profound impact in the classroom, both for educators and students,” said Wang, professor of early education and learning sciences in the Graduate School of Education.\\nBuilding upon UB’s rich history of AI research\\nThe award builds upon a rich history of AI research at UB that dates back decades to when computer scientists, including Govindaraju, developed a handwriting-recognition system that has saved the U.S. Postal Service hundreds of millions of dollars by automating the sorting of mail.\\nMore recently, UB has made strategic investments in both people and programs to enhance the university’s national leadership in AI, including forming the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and the Center for Information Integrity.\\n“The institute will launch new, innovative courses at the intersection of AI and education to help prepare the next generation of undergraduate and graduate students to excel at multidisciplinary research that can have broad societal impact,” said Provost A. Scott Weber. “The institute’s pathbreaking research will raise UB’s profile as an AI powerhouse and attract the best students from around the world and help the university elevate its ranking.”\\nTripathi praised congressional leaders for their continued support of UB, whose mission is to bring the benefits of its research and scholarship to local and global communities in ways that impact and positively change the world.\\n“We want to thank U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Congressman Brian Higgins for their longstanding support of federally funded university research. Time and again they have demonstrated how deeply they value the ability of academic research to solve real-world problems, and their commitment is creating opportunities for people across our state and nation to thrive,” he said.\\nAdditional partners include the Buffalo Public Schools; Amherst Central School District, Amherst, New York; Sweet Home Central School District, Amherst, New York; Washoe County School District, Reno, Nevada; The Summit Center, Amherst, New York; Buffalo-area Engineering for Minorities; Nevada Robotics, Desert Research Institute; Gigi’s Playhouse, Buffalo, New York; Western New York STEM Hub; and UB Early Childhood Research Center.\\nUBNow\\nContact Us\\nAbout UBNow\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

I took a computer science class in high school but didn\\'t think it was something I was going to pursue.  But I like computer science classes.  I still use math-oriented logic skills and I still like the theory, but I like the practicality and applicability of computer science.  Mesh it with something medical down the road or something artsy down the road.\"\\nMeg, a self-described military brat, finished high school in Chittenango, N.Y., following stints in North Dakota, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Colorado.  Why UB? That\\'s easy.  \"Cost.\"  When she and her dad visited CSE\\'s open house, Nick Di Rienzo (CS BS \\'15) gave a talk about his experiences at Google, first as an intern and then as a new hire.  Meg\\'s dad was sold: \"UB is the cheapest school you applied to and all these kids have all these opportunities.\"  \"So I decided to stick it out with computer science,\" Meg continued.  \"But they do have the math department here.  You can do literally whatever you want.  I wasn\\'t 100% sure what I wanted to do and the open house enlightened me.\"\\nIn her years in CSE, Meg has added practically every student leadership role to her CV: UB ACM Chapter President.  Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) for Carl Alphonce and later for Atri Rudra.  CSE Student Advisory Board Chair.  TechSavvy volunteer.  Student Association fundraiser.  Open house presenter.  UB Hacking \\'16 co-director, with Sanjee Choudhery: \"We\\'ve always gotten more people every year.  I wanted to make sure we continued that.  We had at least 350 or 400 this year.  And we had Indian food, Chinese food, not just pizza.\"\\nMeg has a job lined up at Bloomberg in New York City.

Erdem Sariyuce, Sangwoo Shin and Ziming Zhao – will receive a total of nearly $3.8 million for projects that address pressing societal problems.\\nThe researchers will use their expertise to advance AI-powered medical imaging, develop lubricants for longer lasting cars, catch cybercriminals, protect devices from hackers, and better understand cellular and genomic processes that could lead to new medicine.\\n“At UB, we are committed to providing our early-career researchers with the resources and support needed to effectively address society’s most pressing challenges. By doing so, we're fostering a culture of collaboration and enabling the next generation of scientific leaders to accelerate discoveries, develop technologies and move innovations to impact, transforming communities locally and around the globe,” says Venu Govindaraju, vice president for research and economic development.\\nUB’s 2023 awardees:\\nPriya Banerjee, PhD\\nAssistant Professor of Assistant Professor of Physics\\nCollege of Arts and Sciences\\nAward amount: $925,000\\nBanerjee’s project focuses on special proteins called transcription factors (TFs) and a subset called pioneer transcription factors (PTFs).\\n“Transcription factors are proteins that begin the process by which information flows from our DNA to RNA to proteins,” he says. As a biophysicist, his interest is in the mechanisms by which the TFs switch on a particular gene. Given that our genomic DNA is severely compacted — a six-foot strand carrying about 30,000 genes is contained in each cell — most of the time, a particular gene cannot be physically accessed for transcription. TFs control when and how genes in our DNA are expressed.\\nBanerjee plans to work with SayYesBuffalo to provide mentorship and research opportunities in his lab to underrepresented students and Buffalo Public Schools teachers. He also plans to work with the Coalesce Center for Biological Art (part of the Genome, Environment and Microbiome Community of Excellence at UB) to promote biophysics education through art exhibits.\\n“Art communicates scientific findings in lucid and visually enticing ways to help understand complex systems,” he says.\\nMingchen Gao, PhD\\nAssistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering\\nSchool of Engineering and Applied Sciences\\nAward amount: $578,519\\nWhat if a patient could get an accurate assessment of a rash on their skin by simply pulling out their phone and taking a photo of the infected area?\\nThis is the future that Gao aims to create through the advancement of AI-powered medical imaging diagnostics. She will create algorithms that help machine learning models analyze medical images, leading to improved clinical decisions and more confidence in AI-assisted health care.\\n“Life-threatening diseases could be caught early or avoided entirely,” says Gao.\\nGao aims to improve the performance of deep learning models in clinical environments, where data may be limited, patient populations may be more diverse, and rare diseases cannot be ignored, as in simplified lab settings. She will train the models not to forget previous information upon learning new information, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting.\\nThe project will involve a diverse cohort of student researchers, as well as work to help ensure consistent screening services for glaucoma are provided in underserved communities.\\nPrathima Nalam, PhD\\nAssistant Professor of Materials Design and Innovation\\nSchool of Engineering and Applied Sciences/College of Arts and Sciences\\nAward amount: $667,017\\nWear caused by friction is a widespread problem in machines, leading to shorter lifecycles, increasing waste and a growing environmental burden. \\n“In the automotive industry alone, nearly 5% of global energy consumption is a result of energy loss due to friction,” says Nalam.\\nTo address these challenges, Nalam will develop efficient, low-pollutant lubricants. She will investigate the physical behavior and viscoelastic properties of two-dimensional materials as potential lubricant additives to protect engine walls. The layered structure of the materials would allow the intercalation, or insertion, of small molecules such as oil between its layers to better lubricate surfaces.\\nThe results will advance the application of 2D materials as coatings to reduce friction loss — and, therefore, wear and tear — in gears and engines.\\n“Exploring liquid behavior within nanoconfined spaces holds the promise of unlocking a novel ability to manipulate material surfaces,” says Nalam. “This presents significant opportunities in energy storage, catalysis and the development of super lubricious surfaces.”\\nThe project will also provide summer research training for underrepresented students, fostering skills that enable the acceleration of material discovery and development. \\nA. Erdem Sariyuce, PhD\\nAssistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering\\nSchool of Engineering and Applied Sciences\\nAward amount: $555,821\\nNetworks that transfer money and messages are all around us. And they are open to attacks. Sariyuce aims to better detect cyberattacks and connect the dots between money launderers. \\n“Money transfers, communications between computers and face-to-face interactions are all networks,” says Sariyuce. “So, analyzing networks is critically important for bank fraud detection, ensuring cyber-secure environments and even preventing pandemics.”\\nSariyuce will focus on temporal networks, which contain links that are only active at certain points in time. Their temporality amplifies the diverse nature of networks, obscures the notion of scale and explodes the size, he says. The research could aid the detection of money laundering through cryptocurrency.\\n“Cartels love Bitcoin,” Sariyuce says. “Cryptocurrencies create an illusion of privacy where we don’t know who is who but see all the transactions. Temporal motif-based methods can offer a systematic way to detect anomalies in which coordinated illicit activities occur.”\\nSariyuce will organize computer science workshops for high school students from Hispanic, Burmese and Somali communities in Buffalo with the help of community organizations.\\nSangwoo Shin, PhD\\nAssistant Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering\\nSchool of Engineering and Applied Sciences\\nAward amount: $500,000\\nCellular organisms and cell parts relentlessly move around the body to perform various functions. Understanding this movement could provide insight into how wounds heal, pathogens are transmitted and cancer spreads. It can even lead to new approaches for treating wastewater and helping therapeutic drugs reach their targets.\\nShin will explore one important aspect of cells that affects their movement: lipid bilayers, or the thin membranes encapsulating the cell that control the entry or exit of water and ions. \\n“By delving into the fundamental physics governing the motion of these microscopic entities, our research has the potential to advance our understanding of life itself,” says Shin.\\nThe study will synthesize lipid vesicles — cell-mimicking droplets that are encapsulated by lipid membranes — and observe their motion in various conditions under a microscope. \\nThe project will also promote diversity and inclusion in the science, technology, engineering and math fields by providing research opportunities to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups.\\nZiming Zhao, PhD\\nAssistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering\\nSchool of Engineering and Applied Sciences\\nAward amount: $564,748\\nThere are billions of smart devices worldwide, ranging from self-driving cars to smart refrigerators and thermostats. These devices are often vulnerable due to flawed security, and attackers are increasingly leveraging these weaknesses to infiltrate corporate networks.\\nZhao aims to discover and correct the vulnerabilities in trusted execution environments (TEEs), a core component of Internet of Things (IoT) device security.\\n“The vast number of these devices and their crucial role in our daily lives makes it imperative to prioritize their security,” says Zhao.\\nIn addition to improving TEEs security, Zhao also aims to advance the education pedagogy of Internet of Things security.\\n“The project's broader significance and importance, beyond securing the IoT infrastructure, are to train the next generation of cybersecurity researchers, educators and practitioners with deep theoretical understandings and practical skills in this field,” he says.\\nMedia Contact Information\\nTom Dinki\\nNews Content Manager\\nPhysical sciences, economic development\\nTel: 716-645-4584\\ntfdinki@buffalo.edu\\nUB is actively monitoring developments related to COVID-19.

At UTSA, he\\'ll continue his work in data privacy and data computation security.\\nIn his five years at UB, Zhan published at leading conferences including the ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security (ACM CCS) and the ACM Multimedia Conference (ACM MM).  The work that he published at ACM CCS\\'16, \"Heavy Hitter Estimation over Set-valued Data with Local Differential Privacy\", also won the CSE Best Graduate Student Research Award in 2016.\\n\"My research area is data privacy,\" he said.  \"Cloud-based, user data privacy.  In the real world, big companies are collecting your data every day with permission hiding in a long \\'terms of service\\' contract.  For them, compromised privacy is a big potential data risk breach.  Someday there might be a breach like what happened in Sony or other incidents happening in the last few years.  These companies hold such data but can utlilize only a very little portion of them.  Minimize risk, find that value in them.  Privacy-preserving data mining.  Find some valuable, meaningful info from data where user\\'s privacy is protected.\"\\nZhan, a native of Beijing, made his way to UB after earning a BS at the Beijing Institute of Technology and an MS at Columbia University.  He was attracted to UB by the opportunity to work with Kui Ren, whom he describes as \"a rising star in security.\"\\n\"Zhan is very intelligent and persistent with his research,\" said Dr. Ren.  \"He has great potential to be very successful in his future academia career.\"\\nZhan is excited about his upcoming move.  \"San Antonio has a pretty strong security group there,\" he said.  \"Ravi Sandhu (director of the UTSA Institute for Cyber Security) is a big name in security area.  I\\'m happy to join their team.\"\\nStill, he\\'ll miss his friends and collaborators in Buffalo.  \"At UB, CSE faculty are pretty nice and friendly,\" he said.  \"Very diverse expertise.

       " Document(page_content='UBNow\\nNews and views for the UB community\\nOctober 20, 2023\\nCAMPUS NEWS\\nRESEARCH NEWS\\nYOUR COLLEAGUES\\nWORKING AT UB\\nUB SEEN\\nDRIVEN TO DISCOVER PODCAST\\nUBNow Stories Groundbreaking computer scientist Sargur Srihari dies at 72\\nCAMPUS NEWS\\nGroundbreaking computer scientist Sargur Srihari dies at 72\\nUBNOW STAFF\\nPublished March 10, 2022\\nShare This\\nPrint\\nSargur Srihari\\nSargur “Hari” Srihari, an internationally renowned UB professor of computer science who taught computers to read handwriting and significantly advanced the fields of pattern recognition, computational forensics and machine learning, died March 8 due to complications from a glioblastoma. He was 72.  \\nA SUNY Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and UB faculty member for more than 40 years, Srihari established the university as a leading center for pattern recognition and machine learning. He founded the Center of Excellence for Document Analysis and Recognition (CEDAR), which did groundbreaking research for the U.S. Postal Service in the 1990s, ultimately teaching machines how to read handwritten envelopes. This work at CEDAR, which received total funding of more than $60 million over 25 years, led to handwritten digit recognition being recognized as the “fruit fly” of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\\n“Dr. Srihari was, quite simply, a towering figure in computer science,” said President Satish K. Tripathi. “Always at the cutting edge of innovation, he transformed pattern recognition, machine learning and computational forensics with findings that brought global renown to UB and had a profound impact on society.\\n“Beyond his truly exceptional research contributions, Hari was a devoted university citizen and dedicated mentor. In his own patient, gentle and encouraging manner, he inspired generations of aspiring computer scientists to excel in their own right,” Tripathi said.\\n“As we at UB join the world’s computer science community in mourning the passing of this incomparable scholar, I would like to offer my heartfelt condolences to Hari’s wife, Professor Rohini Srihari, his children and his entire family.”\\nSrihari’s research advances, which have received seven U.S. patents, paved the way for the handwriting-recognition technology that is used in modern systems ranging from tablets to scanners. His early research work on 3D imaging also remains influential in fields such as 3D printing.\\nSrihari later would become a pioneer in the field of computational forensics. In 2002, he conducted the first computationally based research to establish the individuality of handwriting, with important implications for the criminal justice community.\\nThis work led to the first automated system, known as CEDAR-FOX, for determining whether two handwritten samples came from the same or different writers. The handwriting work was eventually extended to comparing fingerprints and footwear prints. The work led to Srihari being invited to serve as the only computer scientist on a National Academy of Sciences’ committee that produced an influential 2009 report on strengthening forensic sciences in the U.S. that has had a major impact in courts worldwide.\\n“This is a tremendous loss, not only for UB’s computer science and engineering family, but for the world of computer science,” said Jinhui Xu, professor and chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. “Hari was greatly admired by his students, UB faculty members and researchers throughout the world.”\\nKemper Lewis, dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, called Srihari “a renowned researcher in artificial intelligence” who was a “widely respected expert in statistical pattern recognition and deep learning.”\\n“Hari cherished his role as a researcher, professor and scientist, and he will be deeply missed by his department, our school and our university,” Lewis said.\\nSrihari is survived by his wife of 45 years, Rohini, UB professor of computer science and engineering; his sons, Dileep Srihari and Ashok Srihari (Caroline); and granddaughter, Vera Srihari.\\nA memorial fund, the Professor Sargur (Hari) Srihari Memorial Fund, has been established to support student scholarships. Donations can be made here.\\nBorn in Bangalore, India, Srihari earned an undergraduate degree in electrical and communication engineering from the world-renowned Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore in 1970. Immigrating to the U.S. later that year, he obtained an MS (1972) and PhD (1976), both in computer and information science, from The Ohio State University. His doctoral thesis focused on the design and evaluation of classification algorithms for a type of pattern recognition related to radar aircraft identification.\\nAfter receiving his PhD, Srihari joined the faculty at Wayne State University. He came to UB in 1978.\\nDuring his career, Srihari authored more than 350 research papers with 20,000 citations (h-index=64); edited five books; and served as principal adviser to 40 doctoral students.\\nHe was the recipient of numerous honors, among them the IAPR/ICDAR Outstanding Achievements Award in 2011 for his outstanding and continued contributions to research and education in handwriting recognition and document analysis, and services to the community; the Distinguished Alumnus of the Ohio State University College of Engineering in 1999; and the UB Excellence in Graduate Mentoring Award in 2018.\\nHe held fellowships in the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR) and the Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineers (IETE, India), and was a life fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).\\nIn his later years, Srihari remained an active faculty member, continuing to teach and supervise graduate students. He also developed an extensive set of lecture slides for machine learning, which are widely used in courses around the world.\\nHis final teaching efforts were focused on integrating the wealth of research being produced in deep learning from various books, papers and blogs. He served as a visiting professor and scientist at his alma mater, the Indian Institute of Science, during spring 2020, and later established a scholarship there. During the pandemic, he began recording videos of his explanation of topics in deep learning, and did livestreaming as well.\\nHe enjoyed traveling with Rohini to Washington, D.C., and Florida to visit their sons and granddaughter. He also continued to read avidly while pursuing his lifelong love of history, science and gardening.\\nUBNow\\nContact Us\\nAbout UBNow\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

At a minimum, BFA students perform in four faculty led performances (musicals, drama theatre shows, university choir, or Zodiaque). Student productions provide a great opportunity for both directing and performance experience, but are not applicable to the performance requirement for the degree. BFA Students are required to audition each semester, but must have a 3.000 major GPA to be eligible to be cast. Students can begin performing as early as their second semester first year. BFA Students are also required to complete three practicums, which include crew assignments on one of the eight departmental productions each year.\\nTransfer Credit Policy\\nStudents will be placed in the appropriate level of technique courses based on this evaluation, which may not correspond directly to student’s academic year. A core requirement of the Music Theatre BFA is the students’ practical work on and in productions. As performers, students need to be in residence at UB in order to complete degree requirements.\\nCurricular Plan\\nA Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time.

Certificates are non-degree-granting programs that enhance our degree programs by conveying deep knowledge in one specific research area.  The department offers several of them at the undergrad and grad levels.\\nJacob describes some of the courses that comprise the Certificate in Data Intensive Computing.  \"Bina Ramamurthy teaches CSE 487: Data Intensive Computing,\" he said.  \"You also have to take CSE 486: Distributed Systems and do a research project. Biological data science or anything in data science. That\\'s what pointed me to data science. Carl Alphonce teaches using the Eclipse integrated development environment and became interested in collecting Eclipse data.\"\\nThe goal of the investigation, still in its preliminary phase, is to use programming data to identify struggling student programmers in order to deliver special assistance to them. \"The highlight of that project is finding a field I\\'m interested in, which is data science, and data intensive computing, and then seeking out the faculty to pursue it in more depth than the course offered.\" He later became a teaching assistant for Bina Ramamurthy, who is \"always on the lookout for interesting stuff.\"\\nJacob, a Webster, N.Y. native, is fielding multiple job offers in the Rochester, N.Y. area. His data science expertise, research work, teaching experience, and perfect 4.0 GPA make him an employer\\'s ideal job candidate.\\n\"Identifying the trending fields is important,\" he said. \"I chose UB because of the computer engineering program.

Don’t worry-you can create your own. (Yes, really!) The special studies program is the perfect choice if you want everything UB has to offer, but we don’t have your exact major, or maybe you want to combine different areas. It’s not for everyone-but that’s the point. If you’re resourceful, determined and enjoy making your own path, then take a closer look at what special studies offers. \\nVisit the Special Studies academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.\\nOverview\\nThe Special Studies degree program at UB enables students to design a unique academic path to an undergraduate degree. Students create an individualized academic major, from the vast curricular and faculty resources available at UB, which reflects a student’s unique academic interests and aspirations. Special Studies majors are purposeful, coherent programs of study, sponsored and approved by the faculty, and allow students to achieve individualized academic goals.\\nStudents must have a 2.5 minimum GPA to propose a Special Studies major. Students develop a special major proposal that includes support from two faculty sponsors.  The proposal is then reviewed and approved by a faculty committee and the Dean of Undergraduate Education. A well-constructed proposal clearly outlines the rationale for the special major, shows a deliberately formulated plan of study that defines and reflects the student’s educational objectives at UB.\\nCourse Requirements\\nCourse requirements are determined based on the Special Studies major proposal, developed by the student and their faculty sponsors and approved by a faculty committee and the Dean of Undergraduate Education. The curriculum should lead to mastery of the area of knowledge described in the program description. Coursework should provide both breadth and depth in the area of knowledge being pursued. Most Special Studies majors contain between 32 and 50 credits of requirements drawn from across university offerings.\\nThe special major may not duplicate any existing degree program in the university. Special majors cannot be used to propose academic concentrations similar to existing university programs with the intention of circumventing specific requirements.\\nApproval of a special major does not guarantee access to courses from departments that limit their enrollments to majors only. It is the student’s responsibility to negotiate with the respective departments for those restricted courses which are integral to the proposed major concentration.\\nSpecial majors cannot be proposed in areas where certification or licensure is required by state or professional boards of accreditation (e.g., nursing, engineering). Special majors may also not suggest that the student is acquiring professional competence as a therapist (programs titled Art Therapy, Psychotherapy, etc. are prohibited).\\nIn addition to the requirements set forth in the Special Students major proposal, all university degree requirements must be met, including (but not limited to):\\nMinimum of 120 and maximum of 126 total credits.\\nResidency requirement of 30 credits.\\nAll UB Curriculum (general education) requirements completed.\\nAt least 45 credit hours at the upper division (at least 300-level), including at least 24 credits within the Special Studies major.\\nB.A. degrees require 90 Liberal Arts and Sciences credits. The Liberal Arts and Sciences comprise the disciplines of the humanities, natural sciences and mathematics, and social sciences. \\nTotal Credits Required for Graduation: 120-126\\nTotal Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.\\nAcademic Requirements\\nStudents must have a minimum overall GPA of 2.5, at the time of application. A minimum 2.00 GPA in both the major and the overall academic record is required for graduation.\\nThe Special Studies proposal consists of the following:\\nDegree title: The title should reflect the purpose and content of the major.\\nProgram description: This describes the academic purpose of the special major, including a description of the area of knowledge to be mastered through the special major.\\nProgram Learning Objectives: Statements describing what the student will know and be able to do as a result of completing the degree requirements.\\nList of specific courses and curriculum requirements. The curriculum should lead to mastery of the area of knowledge described in the program description. Coursework should provide both breadth and depth in the area of knowledge being pursued. Most Special Studies majors contain between 32 and 50 credits of requirements drawn from across university offerings.\\nA Curriculum Map showing the connection between the required courses and the Program Learning Objectives.\\nA curricular plan outlining the specific courses (both major and degree requirements) to be taken across 8 semesters.\\nLetters of support from two faculty sponsors.\\nAny tutorial work (496, 498 or 499) should be briefly described indicating the sponsor of the activity, the faculty person who is responsible for grading, and the process of evaluation for the tutorial work. Letters of support should be included from any external site sponsors (i.e., for internships or similar field placements). Independent study courses must be described and approved using the standard independent study form. Study abroad programs and courses should be specifically identified and described.\\nAll major courses transferred to UB from other schools must be formally designated and identified. Transfer courses may comprise no more than 50% of the major curriculum.\\nLearning Outcomes\\nEach special major is unique. Therefore, the learning outcomes will differ by program.\\nReturn to: Majors and Combined Degrees\\n\\na\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

He also recently founded the Science and Computing Club (SoCo). The student organization aims to bring together students from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and beyond to discuss current, pressing issues like political polarization on social media, technology addiction, and algorithmic bias.  \\n“I enjoy how research-oriented the professors are, and how open they are to working with undergraduates. ”\\nAlex Liu, undergraduate student\\nComputer Science\\nWhere are you from?\\nRochester, N.Y.\\nWhy did you choose to go into engineering?\\nMy dad got me into coding when I was young. Plus, the grade school that I went to was very STEM-oriented so that also inspired me to pursue engineering. \\nWhat do you like most about engineering at UB?\\nI enjoy how research-oriented the professors are, and how open they are to working with undergraduates. Some of the projects I've helped out with and heard about have been really rewarding and interesting.\\nWhat motivated you to start the Society and Computing Club?\\nFor a good part of my undergraduate career I've been interested in computer science topics like algorithms, machine learning, and big data. Aside from a few ethics-related assignments in my CS classes, most of my understanding of the negative effects of these industries has come from science fiction, be it AI ruling the world or algorithms that determine future-criminals before they become them (I've only understood recently that this is indeed happening in real life). \\nWatching the documentary The Social Dilemma changed all that. Not only did I begin to learn how real and pervasive the effects of computing on society were, but I also noticed how much it affected my own life. Seeing scenes in the documentary like getting sucked down a YouTube rabbit hole, worrying about your image on social media, and feeling the addictive urge to check your cell phone were especially powerful because I have personally experienced all of these behaviors. The biggest gut punch was when I realized that the academic interests I mentioned – algorithms, machine learning, big data – were the very technologies that enabled these behaviors. This is the reason why I started the Society and Computing Club: As an engineer, to learn how I can create technologies responsibly and ethically in my future career; As a citizen, to understand the effects of computing on democracy, mental health, privacy, and other aspects of society.\\nWhat are the goals of Society and Computing?\\nSociety and Computing (SoCo) does not claim to have the answers to the problems that we discuss, such as political polarization on social media, technology addiction, and algorithmic bias. Rather, our main goal is just to start a conversation around these problems among the student population. And to fully respect the breadth and depth of these problems, we will need as diverse a body of people as possible involved in this conversation. That's why another one of my goals for this club is to be interdisciplinary, both in terms of the student body, but also in terms of the faculty speakers we bring in. The final goal is to promote research projects related to society and computing that faculty are performing around campus.\\nIs there anything particularly exciting that your organization is doing?  \\nYes! For our inaugural event, we will be discussing the documentary The Social Dilemma. We're also really excited about our upcoming speaker series, starting in March. We anticipate having UB professors in philosophy, communications, and computer science talk about their research and work related to society and computing. Some topics include AI ethics, political speech on social media, and machine learning in society. \\nWhat are you working on right now?\\nI'm working on getting the word of this club out to students. We currently have lots of interest from within the CSE department, but there is a lot more outreach to be done within SEAS as a whole, and also outside SEAS. Besides that, we're working to recruit more faculty to come join our speaker series!\\nWhat are you passionate about?\\nI'm passionate about learning from a diverse array of fields, not just that of my major. Many of the questions we want to ask in this club cannot be solved by computer science and engineering alone. We need to examine these problems from all different academic angles, and I want to prepare myself for that. \\nHas there been a particular faculty member that has been formative during your time at UB?\\nProfessor Atri Rudra has been instrumental in my development as a student and researcher. I took his introductory algorithms class a few years back and really enjoyed it. After that class, I did (and still am doing) theoretical computer science research with him. It was during our research meetings that the idea for SoCo was seeded, and he was instrumental in helping me get this club up and running. Through this process we discovered our mutual interest in society and computing related topics, and he was able to introduce me to many other faculty members that helped the club's start in one way or another. In all these settings, Atri has been honest, insightful, and overall a great person to talk to. It's been awesome getting to know him over my undergraduate career!\\nWhat are your future plans?\\nRight now my plan is to pursue a PhD after I graduate. Hopefully I will be able to do research that is relevant to SoCo, as that is my primary interest. \\nWhat is your advice for prospective students?\\nMy main advice to prospective students is to challenge yourself to be as interdisciplinary of a student as possible. This could mean taking as many classes as possible outside of your major, getting involved in interdisciplinary clubs, or adding a minor or a second major (finances and time permitting). \\nPersonally, I've really enjoyed taking non-STEM courses not because I don't enjoy STEM, but because doing so has actually enhanced my experience as a STEM major. First, I believe that doing so directly improves your skills within your own major. As an example, my experience reading court case arguments in law class has made me much better at writing proofs for theoretical computer science courses and research. Second, you will be introduced to all sorts of cool and new academic fields. This happened to me after I took an economics class, when I discovered the wonderful world of game theory sitting at the intersection of economics and computer science. Most importantly, stepping outside your academic comfort zone is a great way of introducing yourself to fresh ways of thinking and looking at the world, while sharpening your own critical thinking skills. \\nTo learn more or join the Society and Computing Club, email avliu@buffalo.edu or fill out the club interest form.  \\nConnect With Us\\nComputer Science and Engineering\\n338 Davis Hall\\nBuffalo, New York 14260-2500\\n(716) 645-3180\\nQuick Links\\nWhy Choose CSE?\\nNews & Events\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nGive to CSE\\nContact Us\\nAdmissions\\nUndergraduate Admissions\\nGraduate Admissions\\nExplore Further\\nGet Involved\\nEngineering and Applied Sciences Alumni Association\\nSupport SEAS\\nCollaborate with UB\\nOn This Website\\nAbout Us\\nUndergraduate Programs\\nGraduate Programs\\nResearch\\nPeople\\nNews & Events\\nFull Site Map\\nInformation For\\nStudents\\nFaculty and Staff\\nAlumni\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

This includes discursive skills for presenting work, explaining concepts and critically engaging the work of others.\\nAcquired an understanding of the historical roles of printmaking and the contemporary practice of print media in art and visual culture.\\n“Learning printmaking helps students trust their intuition and to understand the logic of materials in a very tangible yet indirect way. In a time when academically gifted students feel great pressure to appear verbally confident at every point of the creative process, they often avoid uncertain or vulnerable stages in their studio work and narrow their creative options prematurely. In printmaking, ideas often unfold over a series of distinct stages, making it an ideal medium to teach art students how to become more flexible and responsive thinkers and doers. The very indirectness of printmaking is of great benefit to the development of artists”\\n—- Phyllis McGibbon, Artist and Professor, Wellesley College\\nReturn to: Majors and Combined Degrees\\n\\na\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

Computer science and computer engineering powerfully complement other fields of study.

With Kris I did upper-level courses and with Carl I did 100-level courses.  It\\'s really cool to see how the students have grown in just one to two years.  They\\'re much better at figuring out their work so they\\'re not staying up all night.\"\\nDuring her junior year, she joined the Brain Connectivity project at Buffalo General Hospital, sponsored by the Center for Undergraduate Research & Creative Activities (CURCA) and led by UB neurologist Michael Dwyer. \\n\"It was very interdisciplinary: biologists, people who knew how to code, computer science people.  It combined computer science and neurology.  I worked with MRI data for multiple sclerosis patients.  I\\'d like to continue that or do something similar in the medical field.\"\\nSanjee, who is from Clifton Park, N.Y., also found it easy to find her place in CSE.  \"UB is such a big campus, but computer science is a well-knit community if you choose to be a part of it.  It\\'s not only certain groups of people with certain GPAs who can get involved.\" \\nShe herself has volunteered as UB Association for Computer Machinery (ACM) chapter vice president, \\'15-16; American Association of University Women (AAUW) Tech Savvy volunteer; and UB Hacking \\'16 co-director, with Meg Arnold.\\n\"UB Hacking was a good event to network and meet other students who you could possibly collaborate with and make cool stuff.  I\\'m computer engineering, so I\\'m very good at hardware stuff, and I met people who are very good at software stuff.  In fact, that\\'s how I met some of my current friends.  I was a sophomore, so I hadn\\'t been exposed to Python, C++.  We got to work with a Raspberry Pi.\"\\nAdditionally, Sanjee has served as captain of an Indian fusion dance team, mixing traditional styles with western styles. Competing for the Indian Student Association, her team\\'s 40-member tribute to Mahatma Gandhi won UB\\'s 2016 International Fiesta dance competition. \"The event is a great way to celebrate and explore cultures around the world represented at UB,\" she said.\\nSanjee is heading to Stony Brook in Fall \\'17 to pursue her MS in Computer Engineering. Eventually, she wants to earn her PhD and work in interdisciplinary research.\\nConnect With Us\\nComputer Science and Engineering\\n338 Davis Hall\\nBuffalo, New York 14260-2500\\n(716) 645-3180\\nQuick Links\\nWhy Choose CSE?\\nNews & Events\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nGive to CSE\\nContact Us\\nAdmissions\\nUndergraduate Admissions\\nGraduate Admissions\\nExplore Further\\nGet Involved\\nEngineering and Applied Sciences Alumni Association\\nSupport SEAS\\nCollaborate with UB\\nOn This Website\\nAbout Us\\nUndergraduate Programs\\nGraduate Programs\\nResearch\\nPeople\\nNews & Events\\nFull Site Map\\nInformation For\\nStudents\\nFaculty and Staff\\nAlumni\\n© 2023 University at Buffalo.

       " Document(page_content='CHAPTER\\n2\\nGRADUATE PROGRAMS\\n2.1 The MS and PhD Degrees\\nThe Department of Computer Science and Engineering offers two graduate degrees:\\n• the Master of Science (MS), and\\n• the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).\\n2.2 Admission to the Graduate Programs\\nStudents may apply into either the MS or the PhD program. On successfully completing the MS pro-\\ngram, a student may apply for entry into the PhD program. Students admitted to the MS program will be\\nadmitted to one of several tracks (see Section 3.1).\\n2.3 Admission to the PhD Program from the MS Program\\nAny MS student who is completing the breadth course requirements specified in the PhD Qualifying\\nProcess and who has made arrangements with a major professor (see §4.2) may apply to the Graduate\\nAdmissions Committee for admission to the PhD program.\\nThe application should be submitted by the normal deadlines for PhD admissions (typically in Septem-\\nber for Spring admissions, December for Fall admissions). Exceptions will be considered on a case-by-\\ncase basis.\\nThe University has ruled that a change of program requires a new application on the Application\\nManagement System. The most important materials for an MS-to-PhD program application are:\\n1. A letter from the prospective major professor testifying that the two of you have established a re-\\nsearch relationship, and speaking to your promise for PhD study. This replaces the “Letters of Ref-\\nerence,” and is normally sent directly and privately to the Graduate Admissions Committee. It can\\nalso be submitted online using the Application Management System ( https://ubseasconnect.buffalo.edu/apply/).\\n3', metadata={'source': 'data/grad-handbook-2023.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='GRADUATE HANDBOOK\\n2. A one-or-two-page “Statement of Purpose” describing your plans for doctoral research.\\n3. The form for Application by MS Students for Admission to the PhD Program\\n4. A copy of your UB transcript, plus a separate list of grades in courses you intend to transfer for PhD\\nuse, or have already transferred, if any.\\n5. Financial documentation (international students only).\\nNote that the CSE department may not be able to promise financial support for the first year of PhD\\nstudy at the time the student is admitted to the PhD program.\\nMS students who cannot complete the breadth course requirements specified in the PhD Qualifying\\nProcess by the end of their 2nd year orwho have not made an arrangement with a major professor by the\\nend of their 2nd year will not be admitted to the PhD program.\\n2.4 Advisors\\nUpon admission, you are assigned an academic advisor. This person is not necessarily your “major pro-\\nfessor” (i.e., research supervisor) for the MS project or thesis (as defined in §3.5.1) or the PhD dissertation\\n(as defined in §4.2). When you have come to an agreement with a major professor, that person will be-\\ncome your academic advisor as well. You may request a change of academic advisor at any time. All\\nstudents and academic advisors are urged to meet at least once each semester to review the student’s\\nprogress and course of study.\\n2.5 Approval of the Director of Graduate Studies\\nFrom time to time, you may need to get the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies on various\\ndocuments. Often, you will first need the approval of your academic advisor, so you should always speak\\nto your advisor first. To get the Director’s signature on any forms, please give them to the Graduate\\nCoordinator, who will prepare a packet of relevant supporting documentation and give it to the Director\\nfor his or her signature.\\n4', metadata={'source': 'data/grad-handbook-2023.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='CHAPTER\\n3\\nPROGRAM FOR THE DEGREE OF MASTER\\nOF SCIENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE &\\nENGINEERING\\n3.1 Degree Requirements\\nStudents admitted with a start date prior to Fall 2023 are considered to be in the Research Track. As part\\nof the application process, students will be admitted to the MS Degree Program in one of three tracks : (i)\\nResearch Track, (ii) Systems Course Track, or (iii) AI/ML Course Track.\\n3.1.1 Degree Requirements for Students in All Tracks\\n1. Maintain continuous registration . In particular, you must be registered for at least one graduate\\ncredit the semester prior to degree conferral.

This includes\\nany non-CSE UB courses taken to satisfy the electives. The graduate school’s transfer credits requirement\\nstates that “no more than 20% of a master’s program can be comprised of credits from another graduate\\nprogram at UB, other accredited higher education institutions, or a combination thereof.\\nOnly those graduate courses deemed relevant to CSE and completed with letter grades of B or better\\nare eligible for consideration as transfer credit. If you transfer a course that is the equivalent of a CSE\\ncourse, you may not take the equivalent CSE course here. Credits for courses taken under a quarter\\nsystem are converted to UB equivalents.\\nTo transfer courses, you need to complete the CSE “ Transfer Credit Form ” (available outside the Grad-\\nuate Coordinator’s office), attach the transcript, the syllabus of the course being transferred, and other\\n12', metadata={'source': 'data/grad-handbook-2023.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",

The form needs to be submitted before or at the time the “ Application to Candidacy” (ATC)\\nform is submitted.\\nGetting transfer credit for a course that duplicates a CSE 500-level course does reduce by one the\\nnumber of 500-level CSE courses that you must take. If it is a breadth course, then it also fulfills the\\nrequirement in that focus area (it automatically gives a waiver, as described below). Getting transfer\\ncredit that duplicates a CSE 600-level course in a focus area, however, does not exempt you from the\\nrequirement of a CSE 600-level course from a focus area ; in other words, you must take one 600-level\\ndepth or breadth course here at UB.\\nThe Director of Graduate Studies will note all cases of duplicated courses on the Transfer Credit Form,\\nand such notation shall prevent the student from taking the duplicated course and applying credit for it\\nto any UB CSE degree.\\nThese rules effectively translate the University’s 24-credit residency requirement4into a 24-credit CSE\\nresidency requirement, because the MS program normally requires at least 24 credits of CSE courses!\\nA student who transfers two courses from another institution (i.e., from outside UB) cannot then take\\nnon-CSE UB courses (e.g., from EE, ISE, MGS, etc.) as part of their master’s program. To clarify: Such a\\nstudent can take such a course, but it will not be able to be counted towards the master’s program.\\nCourses taught by CSE Adjunct Professors (on the Graduate Faculty) but numbered in other depart-\\nments do not count as CSE courses; they require “transfer” approval. However, a CSE course, including\\nCSE 700 or CSE 799, or a course crosslisted with a CSE course, taken with such a faculty member would\\ncount as a CSE course.\\n3.2.5 Waiving Requirements\\nIf you have already taken a graduate course similar to a required breadth course, you may apply to the\\nDGS for a waiver of that breadth course. Such waivers can be granted by the DGS after evaluation of your\\ntranscript (including the syllabus of the course proposed to replace the breadth course) and discussion\\nwith you, in consultation with the faculty member(s) who teach(es) that course. Normally, demonstrating\\nthat you received a grade of B or better in one or more graduate courses covering the same material will\\nsuffice.\\nIf you have had a CSE 400-level analog of a 500-level CSE breadth course at UB that is double-listed\\nas CSE 4/5xx (such as CSE 4/531), then you may apply to the DGS for a waiver for the corresponding\\nCSE 500-level breadth course.5\\nTo petition for a waiver of a breadth course, you must submit a request via email to the DGS for ap-\\nproval and attach other relevant information (copy of your transcript and syllabus of the course proposed\\nto replace the breadth course).\\nHaving a breadth course waived does not exempt you from the requirement of 24 credits of CSE\\ncourses at the 500- or 600-level. Nor does it reduce the number of CSE 500- or CSE 600-level courses\\nyou must take—both of these would require getting actual transfer credit for the course. Note that there\\nare restrictions on using courses for one degree that have been used for another degree—see “Double\\nDipping” below.\\nTherefore, having a breadth course waived requires you to replace that breadth course, and it allows\\nyou to replace it with any other 500- or 600-level CSE course that counts toward the MS degree.\\n4https://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.degree-requirements.html#title_2140640841\\n5https://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.degree-requirements.html#title_1714762165\\n13', metadata={'source': 'data/grad-handbook-2023.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

Put another way, at least 24 credits must be “unique to your MS program.”\\nFor example, if you have used CSE 505 and CSE 590 for a master’s degree in mathematics, then you\\nmay also use them for the master’s degree in CSE, but you may not use any other courses from your\\nmathematics master’s program for the CSE master’s, because that would exceed the 6-credit limit. Con-\\ntinuing the example, if you also used CSE 521 for your mathematics master’s, you would still only be able\\nto count two of CSE 505, CSE 521, and CSE 590 towards your CSE master’s degree.\\nNo course can be “triply” counted. For example, if you have taken CSE 521 for your MS and PhD\\ndegrees in electrical engineering, then you cannot use CSE 521 for your CSE degree.\\n3.2.7 Independent Study\\nYou may also receive credit for independent study with a faculty member (CSE 700). After discussing\\nthe work to be performed with the faculty instructor, use the SEAS Force Registration Portal to submit a\\nrequest to register under the specific faculty member’s section before the semester add/drop deadline.\\n3.2.8 Electives\\nThe normal course requirements for an entering student with no background in computer science and\\nengineering at the graduate level include 9 credits of elective courses that may be approved graduate\\ncourses transferred from outside UB or from other departments at UB. Those credits have to include at\\nleast one seminar and at most 6 credits of non-CSE courses.\\nIf you wish to choose elective courses in departments outside CSE, you must first consult your CSE\\nadvisor. The usual criteria for approving a non-CSE course are that either the course focuses on a CSE,\\nScience, or Engineering issue, orit is instrumental to your MS project or thesis research. For example,\\ncourses that teach only programming skills in certain packages, with no significant Computer Science\\nfoundation component, will not normally be approved, unless those skills are needed for your research.\\nThese are merely guidelines for you and your advisor; in general, if your advisor approves your electives,\\nso will the Director of Graduate Studies.\\nThe following is a list of elective courses in departments outside CSE, which have already been ap-\\nproved – you do not need approval from the DGS for any of these courses:\\n• ART 543: Computational Media II — Machine Learning\\n• CSE/LIN/PHI/PSY 575: Intro to Cognitive Science\\n• DEE 501: Engineering Education\\n• DEE 502: Equity and Inclusion in Engineering Education\\n• DEE 520: Computing Education Research\\n14', metadata={'source': 'data/grad-handbook-2023.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",

No more than 2 C or C- grades and\\nno D or F grades are allowed in the credits you use for the MS degree. The U grade indicates failure and\\ncannot be counted towards the required credits. No more than four R grades are allowed.\\nNote that your GPA as computed by the university (and listed on your transcript) will differ from your\\nGPA as computed by CSE for your degree. CSE considers all courses that can be counted towards the\\ncandidate’s degree, whether or not listed on the application to candidacy (ATC), and the highest grade in\\nevery non-repeatable course (repeatable courses include research, seminar etc.). The university consid-\\nersall the courses attempted , including repeats. Our policy is in accordance with the graduate school’s\\npolicy.6In addition, SEAS uniform policy requires that the total of at most two repeat attempts can be\\nmade: one course repeated twice or two courses repeated once each.\\nAn S or U grade will not affect your GPA. Seminars and research are graded on an S/U basis. Inde-\\npendent Study is letter-graded. The UB Graduate School’s Grading Procedures requires that “no more\\nthan 25% of the required credits in a student’s graduate program— excluding courses taken as thesis and\\nproject research —shall be graded on an S/U basis.” Because 25% of 30 rounded down is 7, this allows, for\\nexample, for 6 credits of seminars plus 1 credit of CSE 598. SEAS uniform policy requires that S/U grades\\ncan only be used for project, thesis, dissertation, or courses taken as independent research or seminar.\\n3.3.1 Probation\\nIf at any time your overall GPA slips below 3.00, or you are not otherwise making satisfactory progress\\ntoward the degree (as determined at the semesterly review of all graduate students by the faculty), you will\\nbe put on probation. If you are on probation: (i) You must maintain a 3.0 semester GPA in each semester\\nyou are on probation; (ii) You must achieve a 3.0 cumulative GPA within 2 semesters of being put on\\nprobation. Students to fail to meet these criteria will be dismissed from the program (see Section 8.2).\\n3.3.2 Approval of Course of Study\\nApproval of the full course of study for your degree is given on the Application to Candidacy (ATC) form\\nby the signature of the Chair of the Department or the Director of Graduate Studies. Although the uni-\\nversity provides tools to track your progress towards completing your degree. It is your responsibility to\\ndetermine whether your program (i.e., course selection) is sufficient to meet the requirements. If you have\\nany doubts whether your course selection meets graduation requirements, discuss them with your advi-\\nsor and/or the Director of Graduate Studies as soon as possible. For a summary of these requirements,\\nsee the MS checklist available from the Graduate Coordinator.\\n3.4 Miscellaneous\\n1. Students pre-registering for courses will be limited to a maximum of 12 credits and one seminar per\\nsemester to allow all students to register; These caps will be lifted on the first day of the semester\\nthrough the end of the add-drop period.\\n2.

An initial specification of the\\nproject will be given to the student, who is then expected to develop a more complete specification of the\\nproject and also implement the resulting specs. Both these activities must be carried out in consultation\\nwith the faculty supervisor(s); Unlike a Thesis, multiple advisors are not required.

(See Section 4.7 below.)\\n4.1.1 The Oral Qualifying Exam\\nThe Oral Qualifying Exam (OQE henceforth) is the last component of the depth requirement for PhD\\ncandidacy. The exam is meant to measure three essential qualities of a PhD candidate:\\n• the ability to create new knowledge,\\n• the depth of knowledge in the topic of study, and\\n• the ability to communicate knowledge in scholarly writing and in presenting.\\nThe OQE is designed so that PhD students start a research relationship with an advisor as early as possible\\nin the PhD study. The OQE does not impose extra labor beyond what a PhD candidate will have to do\\nanyhow – that is to do research .\\nSince every student has two chances to pass the Oral Qualifying Exam, it is recommended that a fresh\\nPhD admit attempts the first OQE no later than the 5th semester, and an M.S. to PhD admit attempts to\\ntake the first OQE no later than the 6th semester of graduate study. It is the student’s responsibility to\\nensure that the eligibility requirements (see Section 4.1 Item 3.(a)-(d)) must be fulfilled before applying\\nfor and taking the OQE.\\nThe student prepares artifacts to demonstrate his/her (1) depth of knowledge in a topic, (2) ability\\nto create new knowledge, and (3) ability to communicate knowledge in scholarly writing.2These artifacts\\nform a portfolio to be submitted to the advisor, who will determine from the portfolio whether or not the\\nstudent is ready for the oral presentation. The advisor can help with kick-starting the portfolio prepara-\\ntion. The advisor might, for example, give the student a reading list of classic papers on a topic, and ask\\nthe student to write a comprehensive report on it.\\nThe OQE exam committee consists of three members . The exam is administered and chaired by the\\nstudent’s major PhD advisor. Once the student is ready, the student and the advisor select the second\\nOQE exam committee member. The student then submits the “ Application for OQE” form and their\\nportfolio through email, at least 5 weeks before the anticipated exam date, to the Director of Graduate\\nStudies (DGS) and the Graduate Coordinator. Upon verification of the student’s eligibility for taking the\\nOQE, the DGS appoints the third member of the OQE committee – this member is called the independent\\nmember – within 1 week of receiving the student’s portfolio. At this point, the student arranges/finalizes\\nthe date and time for the OQE exam and works with the OQE committee to select a reading list. The\\ncommittee should finalize the OQE reading list at least 4 weeks before the OQE date. It is the student’s\\nresponsibility to ensure that this reading list is finalized in a timely fashion.

The student passes the exam\\nconditionally if only two members give a passing grade, which must include the advisor. The member\\nthat does not give the passing grade will give specific recommendations as to how the student can im-\\nprove, in what aspects of the above criteria to be worthy of a PhD candidacy. If at least two members give\\na failing grade, then the student fails the exam. More details about grading can be found at the “CSE PhD\\nOral Qualifying Exam (OQE) Verification” form. The OQE committee members fill in and sign this form\\nat the end of the exam.

Thus, up\\nto 36 credits of graduate work at another institution can be transferred, if approved by the Director of\\nGraduate Studies. Only those relevant graduate courses completed with grades of B or better are eligible\\nfor consideration as transfer credit.\\nIf you transfer a course that is the equivalent of a CSE course, you may not take the equivalent course\\nat UB CSE.\\nThe Graduate School also requires that at least 36 credits be unique to the PhD degree. For example,\\nif you have obtained a CSE MS degree, you may use all 30 MS credits for your CSE PhD degree. However,\\nyou are then allowed to transfer only 6 credits from another institution. If the MS degree itself included\\n6 transfer credits, these transfer credits could not be used toward the PhD degree and then you would be\\nallowed 12 additional transfer credits.\\nTo transfer courses, you need to complete a “Transfer Credit Form.” Email the grad coordinator for\\nthe necessary paperwork; When requesting paperwork, attach the transcript, the syllabus of the course\\nbeing transferred, and other relevant information, and submit them to the Director of Graduate Studies\\nfor approval. This must be done by the time the Application to Candidacy (ATC) is filed, and should be\\ndone as soon as you have determined which credits you wish to transfer.\\n4.1.3 Waiving Requirements\\nIf you have already taken a course similar to a required breadth course, you may apply to the GSC for a\\nwaiver of that breadth course. See §3.2.5 for details.\\n4.1.4 Independent Study\\nYou may also receive credit for independent study with a faculty member (CSE 700). After discussing\\nthe work to be performed with the faculty instructor, use the SEAS Force Registration Portal to submit a\\nrequest to register under the specific faculty member’s section before the semester add/drop deadline.\\n4.1.5 Grade Requirements\\nIn the program submitted for graduation, you must have at least 72 graduate credits in the right combi-\\nnation of courses.

You may petition the GSC for an extension if you think\\nthere are bona fide reasons for requiring more time.\\nA copy of your dissertation proposal must be given to the Graduate Coordinator and will be kept in\\nyour file.\\n4.7 Dissertation\\nFor information on the format of the thesis (binding, electronic submission, copyrighting, etc.), see the\\nwebpage “PhD Candidate Requirements” and, in particular, the “Guidelines for Electronic Thesis/Dissertation\\nPreparation and Submission” from UB’s Graduate School. The Electronic Thesis and Dissertation FAQs\\nshould answer all of your questions regarding electronic submissions and formatting requirements.\\nIn 2005, the University at Buffalo moved from accepting paper-based/bound copies to requiring only\\nelectronic theses and dissertations for publishing and archiving in an electronic database. The archiving\\nis handled by ProQuest/UMI, the world’s largest recognized repository for dissertations and theses. UB\\nhas contracted with UMI to publish, archive and disseminate graduate research.\\nThe Department requires an on-line copy for the Departmental Technical Report series (see Sec-\\ntion 7.2 for on-line submission instruction), as well as bound copies for each member of the candidate’s\\ndissertation committee. Each copy of a doctoral dissertation must include an abstract not longer than\\n600 words.\\nBecause doctoral dissertations require the joint effort of you and your major professor (and perhaps\\nother members of the faculty), you should make no arrangements for publication without consulting\\n28', metadata={'source': 'data/grad-handbook-2023.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",

The electronic copy submitted to Graduate School and the publication in the de-\\npartmental Technical Report Series do not preclude later publication by other venues.\\n4.7.1 Dissertation Defense\\nYou must defend your dissertation orally in public when it is complete. The Department will not schedule\\nthe defense of a dissertation until at least one year after the acceptance of the dissertation proposal.\\nHowever, a student who completes a dissertation unusually quickly may petition the GSC to allow the\\ndefense less than a year after the proposal.\\n4.7.2 Outside Reader\\nNo outside reader is required. However, an outside reader is permitted.\\nAn outside reader is a qualified individual appointed outside the student’s department who normally\\nholds the highest degree in his or her field. Research or adjunct faculty of the Department of Computer\\nScience and Engineering are not eligible to serve as outside readers of Computer Science dissertations.\\nWherever possible, departments are encouraged to invite faculty from other academic and professional\\ninstitutions to accept this professional responsibility. If the outside reader is chosen from within the\\nUniversity, he or she would normally be a member of the graduate faculty of some other department.\\nThe outside reader should be chosen by you in consultation with your major professor and the other\\nmembers of your committee. Since the purpose of having an outside reader is to obtain the benefit of an\\nobjective expert’s opinion, it is obviously more appropriate to select as outside reader someone who has\\nnot been associated with the research.\\nThe outside reader provides an independent evaluation of the student’s research. Normally this\\nwould be limited to an examination of the final draft of the dissertation. The department may invite\\nthe outside reader to examine the next-to-final draft of the dissertation. Outside readers may ask the stu-\\ndent to discuss the dissertation with them. Decisions regarding criticisms, recommendations for changes\\nin the dissertation, or additional work to be done are made by the major professor and the candidate’s\\ncommittee.\\n4.8 Schedule\\nStudents in the PhD program must adhere to the following schedule:\\n1. The breadth course requirements in the PhD Qualifying Process must be completed by the end of\\nthe second academic year.\\n2. A willing major professor must be chosen before the end of the second academic year. (It is recom-\\nmended that this should be done in the first year.)\\n3. OQE must be successfully completed no later than the 6th semester. (OQE should be attempted no\\nlater than the 5th semester, as the student gets only 2 chances to pass OQE.)\\n4. The Application to Candidacy (ATC) should be submitted by the end of the third year.\\n5. The dissertation proposal must be approved before the end of the fourth academic year.\\n29', metadata={'source': 'data/grad-handbook-2023.pdf', 'page': 35}),\n",

Doctoral degrees must be completed within seven years from the student’s initial\\nformal matriculation in that doctoral program. Requests for extensions of time limits must be pe-\\ntitioned using the Extension of Time Limit to Complete a Degree Program form. Each divisional or\\narea committee may establish its own stricter policies within the constraints of these overarching\\ninstitutional policies.\\nMinor amendments to the ATC which become necessary through changes in registration (e.g.,\\nadding or deleting anticipated courses or credits) must be formalized through the Change of Ex-\\npected Conferral Date/Amend ATC petition. This form must be endorsed by the director of grad-\\nuate studies or chair of the student’s department. These amendments are then reviewed by the\\nGraduate School.\\nThe definition of “end” of an academic year or semester for these and similar purposes is: the last day\\nof exams of that year or semester. Petitions for extensions should be sent to the GSC, or, in the case of\\nUniversity deadlines, to the Graduate School.\\nA student should complete all PhD degree requirements (except the dissertation), complete at least\\n68 required credits, and file the ATC within the first four years of study. After this, the student may register\\nfor only one credit hour per semester while maintaining full-time status.\\nThese rules apply equally to all students, whether enrolled as full-time or as part-time students. A\\nleave of absence has the effect of stopping the clock. You need to file the Graduate School “Graduate\\nStudent Petition Form” for this purpose. However, leaves will be granted only for pressing personal mat-\\nters that unavoidably render a student unable to devote attention to graduate study. Leaves will not be\\napproved for students who intend to continue work toward the PhD while on that leave.\\nIt is our intent that each student graduates with the PhD within six years, and the faculty will work\\nwith you in this endeavor.\\nNote: You may find it odd that the ATC should be submitted by the end of the 3rd year, while the dis-\\nsertation proposal must be approved before the end of the 4thacademic year. Note, though, that the ATC\\n“should” but need not be submitted by the end of the 3rd year, while the dissertation proposal “must” be\\napproved before the end of the 4th. The wording about the ATC form comes from the Graduate School,\\nnot the Department. In fact, the ATC only needs to be submitted a specified time before the graduation\\ndate. But the earlier it is submitted, the earlier one can register for only one credit as a full-time student,\\nwhich is something the Graduate School encourages in order to promote work on the dissertation. In\\ngeneral, the ATC should be submitted as soon as you know all the information it requests, such as com-\\nmittee members and title of dissertation. But you can submit it earlier, with tentative information. If the\\ninformation changes, you then may and must file an amendment to the ATC. (See §4.4.)\\n4.9 Documents and Degree Forms\\n4.9.1 Documents\\nThere are departmental forms to be completed and approved by appropriate signatures for each of the\\nPhD requirements. These forms are available from the departmental Graduate Coordinator. Below is\\na list of the forms required. All must be appropriately dated and signed as indicated on them. All re-\\nquire the signature of the Director of Graduate Studies.

Wherever they are\\nsuspected, potential violations will be investigated, and determinations of fact sought. In short, breaches\\nof academic integrity will not be tolerated.\\n8.3.1 University Statements on Academic Integrity\\nThe Department of Computer Science and Engineering endorses and adheres to the University policy on\\nacademic integrity. Students should be familiar with that policy, as expressed in the following documents:\\n• UB Academic Integrity Policies:\\nhttps://academicintegrity.buffalo.edu/policies.php\\n• UB Graduate School Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures:\\nhttps://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.html#academic-integrity\\n8.3.2 Departmental Statement on Academic Integrity in Coding Assignments and Projects\\nThis statement further describes the specific application of these general principles to a common context\\nin the CSE Department environment, the production of source code for project and homework assign-\\nments. It should be thoroughly understood before undertaking any cooperative activities or using any\\nother sources in such contexts.\\nAll academic work must be your own. Plagiarism, defined as copying or receiving materials from a\\nsource or sources and submitting this material as one’s own without acknowledging the particular debts\\nto the source (quotations, paraphrases, basic ideas), or otherwise representing the work of another as\\none’s own, is never allowed. Collaboration, usually evidenced by unjustifiable similarity, is never permit-\\nted in individual assignments. Any submitted academic work may be subject to screening by software\\nprograms designed to detect evidence of plagiarism or collaboration.\\nIt is your responsibility to maintain the security of your computer accounts and your written work.\\nDo not share passwords with anyone, nor write your password down where it may be seen by others. Do\\nnot change permissions to allow others to read your course directories and files. Do not walk away from a\\nworkstation without logging out. These are your responsibilities. In groups that collaborate inappropri-\\nately, it may be impossible to determine who has offered work to others in the group, who has received\\nwork, and who may have inadvertently made their work available to the others by failure to maintain\\nadequate personal security. In such cases, all will be held equally liable.\\nThese policies and interpretations may be augmented by individual instructors for their courses.

You may occasionally teach an undergraduate course yourself. Under current policy,\\nTAships are reserved for students in the PhD program.\\nGraduate (laboratory) Assistantships (GAs): in which you work in the departmental laboratory, usually\\non software development, maintenance, and support.\\nMost funded students start out as TAs or GAs, unless approached prior to arrival by a faculty member\\nwith an RA offer. Later, when you choose a major professor, that faculty member may have funding to\\nsupport you as an RA.\\nAll assistantships require an average of 16–20 hours of work per week (see §9.5).\\nIf you believe that your supervisor is giving you too much work to do, discuss this first with your\\nsupervisor. If it is still not satisfactorily resolved, see the Director of Graduate Studies.\\n9.2 SPEAK Test\\nThe University requires all graduate students who are non-native speakers of English and who are not\\npermanent residents or US citizens to pass the SPEAK test in order to teach. The Department of Computer\\nScience and Engineering can also require the test for other students who are non-native speakers. Failure\\nto pass the SPEAK test within the first year of your appointment may lead to a non-renewal of the TA or\\nGA.

Normally, only PhD students are eligible for TAships or GAships, subject to the above eligibility\\ncriteria. Both PhD and MS students are eligible for RAships, also subject to these criteria.\\n3. Students may be supported as a TA or GA for a total of no more than 10 semesters (not necessarily\\nconsecutive), subject to the above eligibility criteria.\\n4. Students may be supported by RAships or fellowships (e.g., Presidential Fellowship, SEAS Dean’s\\nFellowship, Fulbright, IGERT, etc.) for the amount of time allowed by the funding source, subject\\nto the above eligibility criteria.

A student’s work obligation is an average of 16–20 hours a week. This is an average over the term of\\nappointment rather than a fixed amount each week.\\n2. Assistants are appointed for either one or two semesters. Assistants appointed for two semesters\\nare appointed for 10 months (normally from the second part of August to the end of May).\\n3. Academic holidays (and the inter-semester break) will normally be holidays for assistants. Some\\nassistants may be asked to work during such holidays in return for time off at some other time.\\n4. TAs are expected to work throughout the semester including the final exam period, starting a week\\nbefore the semester begins and continuing until the grading for the courses they are assigned to\\nis completed. TAs who are not available during the work period may have their assistantships\\nremoved.\\n5. The obligation of RAs does extend after the end of classes in May until May 31, and extends further\\nif they have summer support. The obligation of TAs ends when they are released by their supervi-\\nsor, presumably after final exams are graded.\\n6. TA performance is monitored by the instructor who fills out a TA evaluation form.\\nNo supported student is required to accept an RAship with a particular faculty member. If you accept\\nan RAship, you should know that research is not a 9-to-5 activity. Accept an RAship only if you desire to\\nwork with the faculty member for academic and scientific reasons, not just for the money. The work you\\ndo as an RA should always be integrated into your academic career. For these reasons, the guidelines\\ngiven above (e.g., 16–20 hours per week) are open to negotiation. You should understand clearly what\\nthe faculty member expects from you before you accept the RAship.
