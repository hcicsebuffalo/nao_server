Biochemistry MA
The Department of Biochemistry is dedicated to excellence in biochemical research, with faculty members pursuing cutting-edge research in a variety of disciplines with a common theme of “how living cells work.” Our research utilizes modern techniques, including analysis of molecular structure, bioinformatics, high throughput proteomics and genetics to answer basic questions about how biological molecules determine cellular functions. An integral component of the program is one-on-one training from faculty members to graduate students, such that they develop their full potential as scientists.
