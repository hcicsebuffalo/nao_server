Medical Laboratory Science BS (formerly Medical Technology)
Students entering prior to fall 2023 may request to be moved into the Medical Laboratory Science plan code.
Do you like searching for clues and solving problems? Do you want to play a lead role in diagnosing, treating and preventing diseases? Are you good at bio and chem and working in a lab? If so, then think about majoring in medical laboratory science-a program designed for people who want to learn how to use state-of-the-art equipment and techniques to perform fast, accurate (and often life-saving) lab tests.
Visit the Medical Laboratory Science academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Biotechnical and Clinical Laboratory Sciences department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
Admission Criteria
All prerequisites must be completed prior to the start of the MT program
Minimum 2.000 overall GPA
Minimum GPA of 2.000 in prerequisite courses
Admissions is competitive and granted on space availability. Approximately 18-22 students are accepted each year. All applicants must apply to both UB (matriculation to the University) and to the Medical Laboratory Science Program (to become an approved/ accepted major). At the time of application, candidates must be registered in their final prerequisites.
Current students wishing to pursue this major should visit the Medical Laboratory Science admissions page for more information.
