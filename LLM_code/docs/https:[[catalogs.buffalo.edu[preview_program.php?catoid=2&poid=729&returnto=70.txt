Grantwriting and Fundraising Micro-Credential
This micro-credential offers critical knowledge and professional development for students considering a career in the not-for-profit sector and for those undertaking individual research to benefit that sector. Not-for-profit organizations depend on individuals with fundraising and grant writing knowledge and experience. Prepare yourself to make a difference with a micro-credential that complements curriculums in arts management; the schools of management and social work; and the humanities, arts, and social sciences.
