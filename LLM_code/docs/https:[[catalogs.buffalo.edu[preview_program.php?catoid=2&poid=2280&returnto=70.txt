Strategies for Eliminating Health Inequities Micro-Credential
The micro-credential provides a means to develop the skills and knowledge required for addressing health inequities. Developed specifically for the non-profit and for-profit community, this program consists of two courses and a portfolio building experience. The courses will help you to gain content expertise on the origins of health inequities and will provide the necessary tools for intervening to eliminate health disparities. The development of a portfolio will enable you to demonstrate your ability to design a strategy for reducing health disparities (such as a program, policy initiative or other intervention).
