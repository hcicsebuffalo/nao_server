Engineering Science BS
Engineering science gives you a chance to get a little bit of everything. It’s a flexible and multi-departmental degree that lets you see what you like-and get more of what you love. This program is ideal for people who want to learn how to be well-rounded problem-solvers, using experience from all different disciplines to make an impact on the environment, healthcare or nearly any field. If you’re having a hard time deciding which engineering major to choose, then pick engineering science-and do it all.
Visit the Engineering Science academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.

Learning Outcomes
The curriculum provides opportunities for students to develop the following knowledge, skills, and behaviors by the time of graduation:
an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics.
an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.
an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.
an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.
an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.
an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
