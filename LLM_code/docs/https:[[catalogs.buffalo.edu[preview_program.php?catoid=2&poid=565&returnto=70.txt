Natural Sciences Interdisciplinary MS (Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences)
Our natural sciences interdisciplinary master’s program is distinct from other biomedical master’s programs in the Jacobs School. While those programs are geared toward students looking for a focused experience in one particular discipline, our program gives you a broad overview of the biomedical sciences.

If you’re still deciding whether to pursue medicine or a biomedical research career, we can help you find your path. If you know you want to apply to professional health programs, we’ll strengthen your foundation in basic biomedical sciences coursework, helping you demonstrate that you’re ready.
