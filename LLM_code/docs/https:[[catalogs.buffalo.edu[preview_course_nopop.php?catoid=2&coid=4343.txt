AAP 521SEM - Engagement: An Investigation of Strategies, Stories, and Relationships in Arts Organizations
This course introduces and critically contextualizes the concept of engagement and strategies and scenarios of arts engagement programming. Today¿s museums and performing arts institutions have shifted their focus from presenting cultural content from a predominantly euro-centric perspective and focus on the object or performance to looking to meaningfully reach diverse audiences and communities. This shift manifests through various policies, initiatives, programs and use of digital technologies, that take into account the changing cultural, social, and ethnic fabric of societies, an increasingly screen-focused world, and varied funding sources.
