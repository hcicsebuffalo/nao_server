Early Childhood Education (Birth to Grade 2) EdM
Programs in early childhood and childhood education deal with children from preschool up to the middle school years. The programs in early childhood or childhood education are also available with a bilingual extension/specialization. The initial professional program in early childhood education is designed specifically for graduate students without an undergraduate degree in education, who wish to teach at the early childhood or childhood levels. This program enables those who have majored in approved humanities, social sciences or sciences to pursue a master’s degree, and to satisfy birth through grade six certification requirements.
