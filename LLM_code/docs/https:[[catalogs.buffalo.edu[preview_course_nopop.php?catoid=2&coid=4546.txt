APY 512LEC - Kinship and Social Structure
A central goal of the course is to enable students to view kinship in this society. We will look at some of the famous contributions to kinship studies of the past and relate these to recent developments. Classes will be divided about equally between lectures and discussions and presentations. We will also discuss problems of the kinship of marriage and of kinship related friendship. Graduates will be asked to write a discussion of one society using two different approaches, that is, from two points of view. They will also have an opportunity to lead the discussion of a related group in class.
