The Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University at Buffalo is deeply committed to providing the highest quality undergraduate and graduate education. Many of our faculty have been recognized for outstanding teaching by the university, including the SUNY Chancellor’s Award for Teaching Excellence. The CSE department offers three programs at the undergraduate level: the BA and BS degree programs in Computer Science and the BS in Computer Engineering. The design of these degree programs takes into account the highest national standards for computing curricula set by the ACM and IEEE Computer Societies and the international computer engineering/computer science education accreditation board, ABET.
