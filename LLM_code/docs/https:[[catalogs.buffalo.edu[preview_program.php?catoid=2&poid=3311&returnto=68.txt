Computational Earth Science MS
This MS degree in Computational Earth Science program is aimed at both Earth science graduate students who want to develop expertise in computational research, and graduate students with a background in Computer science who would like to apply those skills to the Earth sciences. The demand for professional labor force skilled in Earth sciences, alongside scientific computation has grown tremendously over the last decade, and all indications are that such growth will further accelerate in the near future. Our program in Computational Earth Science aims to provide students with the skills required to enter the 21st century professional workforce, thus making them highly desirable prospect for employment in industry, government and national laboratories, or to continue on to a doctoral program in the Earth sciences or computational fields.
