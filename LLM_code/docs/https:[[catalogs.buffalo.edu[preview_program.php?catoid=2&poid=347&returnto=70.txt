Architecture MArch/Media Arts Production MFA
The Architecture MArch/Media Arts Production MFA program offers a dual degree for emerging practices that requires expertise in both architecture and computational media. Computing has changed the way we think, feel and operate in the modern world, with profound implications for the way we conceive, perceive and interact within built environments. Parametric and generative design methods, and digital fabrication processes, have altered the ways by which architecture is designed and constructed. A wide range of mobile, embedded and networked media present new opportunities to shape the experience of the built environment.
