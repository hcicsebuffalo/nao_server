AHI 522SEM - Topics in Renaissance Art
This seminar will examine the use and interpretation of perspective in the Italian Renaissance. We will be concerned primarily with the introduction and use of single point perspective as apparently invented by Brunelleschi and theorized by Leon Batista Alberti during the early fifteenth century. We will examine also ways of interpreting naturalistic space not constructed according to single point construction. In genera our approach to viewing Renaissance art will embrace the distinction between vision and visuality.
