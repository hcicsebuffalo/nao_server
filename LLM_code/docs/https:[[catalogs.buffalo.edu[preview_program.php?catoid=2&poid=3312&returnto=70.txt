Engineering Science MS: Microelectronic & Semiconductor Engineering Focus
Semiconductors are the delicate, wafer-thin microchips essential for all electronic devices. Semiconductors, electronic circuits, and microchips form the basis for new and evolving technologies. With the passage of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, the United States is positioned to lead in global semiconductor research, development, and production. Significant expansion of this sector is expected in the next few years, with substantial employment opportunities for qualified engineers. The Engineering Science MS with a course focus in Microelectronic and Semiconductor Engineering provides the knowledge needed to compete for such opportunities.
