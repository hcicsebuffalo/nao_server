Educational Culture, Policy, and Society EdM
Our master’s program in educational culture, policy and society is for you if you wish to explore the role that education (P-16+) plays in the larger society. You will learn how institutions, policies and practices facilitate and/or limit individuals’ well-being and social, economic and educational outcomes. In this three-semester program, you will study education in broad-based social, cultural, political and historical contexts in the United States and other nations. Attention will be directed toward studying the educational policies and practices of underserved populations, including but not limited to historically marginalized racial/ethnic groups in the United States (e.g., African American, Latino/a and non-proficient English speakers) and populations with limited financial resources. You will also explore gender disparities in education, social and economic opportunities, and unequal outcomes in the global context. You will have the opportunity to focus on cross-national differences in education policies and practices.
