Applied Economics - Information and Internet Economics Specialization Advanced Certificate
The program in Information and Internet economics is a cooperative venture of the Departments of Economics, Computer Science and Engineering, School of Informatics, the Management Sciences and Systems program and the School of Law. The program reflects the growth of interest in economics and other disciplines in the ongoing “information revolution” and its impact on transaction costs, industrial composition, financial markets, international trade and exchange and product and process innovation.
The purpose of the specialization is to increase students’ understanding of the impact of information technology in all of these areas. It aims to enhance students’ ability to assess the cost and value of alternative information systems and channels. It also aims at increasing students’ ability to utilize information and econometric tools to provide research and consulting work bearing on the role of information technology at the enterprise and market level.
Emphasis is placed on courses in information economics, industrial organization, and international economics, as well as information systems, e-commerce, data mining, and the legal aspects associated with computer technology and e-commerce.
