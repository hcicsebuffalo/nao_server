Anthropology BA
People-watchers, unite! If you love studying human behavior-past and present-then welcome to anthropology. UB’s anthropology program is the only major that’s focused on humankind as a whole. It’s truly one of the best ways to gain a thorough understanding of human diversity as you study people through a historical, global lens and see how we adapt over time and space. If you’re interested in any discipline such as social science, natural science (like biology and anatomy) and history but want more, then keep reading.
Visit the Anthropology academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Anthropology department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
