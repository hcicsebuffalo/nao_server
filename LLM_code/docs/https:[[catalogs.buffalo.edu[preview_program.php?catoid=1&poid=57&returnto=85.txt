At UB, you’ll be part of the only classics department in the SUNY system, where you can dive into history, archaeology, mythology and more as you draw connections between the past and the present.
Visit the Classics academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
