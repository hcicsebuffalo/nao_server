APY 521SEM - Language, Culture, and Power
This seminar will introduce you to the field of anthropological linguistics. During the course of the semester we will explore together the ethnography of speaking, sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, gender, and issues in the study of dominant and minority languages. The relationship between language, culture, and power will be a focus. Ethno-linguistic genres including life history and autoethnography will be discussed, and examples from realms of education and politics will be used. Students will participate in class discussion of the material assigned and write response papers. Each member of the class will also prepare an annotated bibliography and make an oral presentation on a topic of their choice.
