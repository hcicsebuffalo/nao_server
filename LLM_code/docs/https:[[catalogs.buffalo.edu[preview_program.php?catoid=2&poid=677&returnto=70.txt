Psychology: Clinical PhD
The Clinical Psychology PhD program follows a clinical science model. Clinical science is defined as a psychological science directed at the promotion of adaptive functioning; at the assessment, understanding, amelioration, and prevention of human problems in behavior, affect, cognition, or health; and at the application of knowledge in ways consistent with scientific evidence. We expect our students to contribute to the science of clinical psychology, and to learn to infuse their clinical work with empirical findings and theoretical concepts.

In the first year, core coursework focuses on the introduction to psychopathology, assessment, and intervention, as well as statistics and research methods in clinical psychology.
During the second year, core coursework focuses on advanced statistics, psychological interventions with adults and children, and a full year of practicum training in assessment and intervention.

Clinical electives also are offered on a variety of topics, and the curriculum includes breadth courses in the history of clinical psychology as well as the biological, cognitive-affective, and social bases of behavior.
