PharmD/Business Administration MBA
The School of Management and the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences jointly offer a five-year program leading to the Master of Business Administration (MBA)/Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree. The dual-degree program reduces the usual pattern of a four-year PharmD program and a two-year MBA program, by one year.
The MBA is a valuable credential that can be paired with a number of professional degrees, offering advanced business training concurrently to students pursing professional credentials.  The School of Management offers 6 such “collaborative” offerings:  the MBA/AuD for speech pathologists, the MBA/Real Estate Development MS for planners and developers, the MBA/DDS for aspiring dentists, the MBA/MPH for public health professionals, and the MBA in combination with our surgical residency, for surgeons-in-training.  Contact the School of Management for more information about these time-saving “collaborative” program opportunities.
