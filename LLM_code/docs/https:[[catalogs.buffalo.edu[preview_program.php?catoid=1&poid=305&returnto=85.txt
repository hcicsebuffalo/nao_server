All UB Mathematics majors must complete at least four upper-division mathematics courses, numbered 311-489, excluding MTH 323, MTH 326, and MTH 399, at UB. 
Program Honors and Program Distinction
Majors are eligible for Program Honors upon completion of an honors thesis under the guidance of a faculty advisor. Students typically complete MTH 499 in the fall semester and MTH 497 in the spring semester, although the timing is flexible and students may complete the thesis before their last semester. Students must also meet the remaining Program Honors criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. 
Majors who do not pursue a thesis but have exceptional grades are eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met. These criteria are also found in the Academic Honors policy.
Students who successfully complete Program Honors and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript. Program Distinction is also noted on the official transcript.
