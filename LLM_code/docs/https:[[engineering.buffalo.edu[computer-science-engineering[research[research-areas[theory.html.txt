#40. Theory program national ranking, 2019-2022. Source: csrankings.org
Theory research category introduction and description.
Algorithms and Complexity
Computer science theory assesses which problems are possible and feasible to solve through theories of computability, undecidability, complexity, reducibility, and approximability.
Computer Security and Cryptography
Focuses on applied cryptography, authentication, software and system security, threat modeling, anomaly detection, wireless security, cloud security, human-centered security, differential privacy and empirical cyber security.
RESEARCH RANKING
Excelsior!
UB's institutional reputation in the field of computer science has improved dramatically over the last decade.  By the most valid measure, our national ranking has risen from 50th to 29th.
RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
