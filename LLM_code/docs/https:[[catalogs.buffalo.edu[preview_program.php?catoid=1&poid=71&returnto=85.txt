Criminology BA
Roughly one in every three people in the United States has a criminal record. But what causes someone to commit a crime? What impact can crime have throughout a neighborhood? How does the criminal justice system reinforce racism?
As a criminology major, you’ll ask tough questions about a topic that affects nearly every aspect of society, from health and housing to education and the environment. And then you’ll learn where to find the clues to help answer them.
Visit the Criminology academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Sociology department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
