German BA
Let’s start with 100 million reasons-that’s the number of people who speak German around the world. German is more than one of the most common languages-it’s also one of the international standards for engineering, science, business and many other academic and professional fields. This program is for students who want to be fluent in German, study the largest economy in the European Union, and learn more about the birthplace of Einstein, Arendt, Nietzsche, Beethoven and other world-famous Germans. 
Visit the German academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Linguistics department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
