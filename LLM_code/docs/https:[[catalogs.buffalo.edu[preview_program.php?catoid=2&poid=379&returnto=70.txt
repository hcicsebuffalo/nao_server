A minimum 72 credit hours is required, which may include applicable master’s degree credits. Research leading to a doctoral degree requires at least two years of full-time research in addition to fulfilling the course requirements.
A wide range of cutting-edge research is ongoing, including:
Cancer epidemiology to identify modifiable risk and prognostic factors
Development and application of risk and prognostic biomarkers
Intervention trials for cancer risk reduction
Intervention trials for prognostic benefits
Population-based studies of Omics (i.e., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, etc.)
Cancer survivorship
Cancer health disparities

A written dissertation and oral defense of the thesis is required for graduation.
  Cancer Genetics and Computational Oncology PhD Track
The Cancer Genomics, and Computational Oncology Track emphasizes cutting-edge basic and translational research, conducted using both experimental and computational approaches, performed with outstanding scientific rigor and reproducibility, leading to high quality publication of students’ work.
Students in CGCO track can choose between two concentrations of course work:  a Cancer Genetics and Genomics concentration, or a Computational Oncology concentration.  Both concentrations will gain some expertise in bioinformatics, but the Computational Oncology concentration students will get further in-depth training in computational biology.
We stress critical evaluation of published data through our journal clubs and acquisition of oral communication skills through seminar courses. You’ll also participate in professional development by attending international conferences and presenting your research.
Research areas
Faculty research interests cover a broad spectrum of cancer genetics and molecular biology, with exceptional strengths in:
Isolation and characterization of cancer genes
Somatic cell genetics
High-throughput genomics, proteomics, and epigenomics
