Jewish Studies BA
If you like thinking about philosophy, religion and questions that don’t have a “right” answer, then Jewish studies might be the perfect fit for you. Here, you’ll tackle questions like: What is God? What makes us human? Can we accommodate both science and religion in our belief? Jewish studies is for anyone who wants to learn how to think critically about beliefs and facts-a valuable skill that can lead to a surprising variety of careers.
Visit the Jewish Studies academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
