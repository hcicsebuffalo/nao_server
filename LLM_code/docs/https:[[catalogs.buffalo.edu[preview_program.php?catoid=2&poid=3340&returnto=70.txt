Curriculum
Students complete the first and second professional year in the PharmD curriculum. In the third year, students complete both required and elective MPH courses. In the fourth year, students take courses in both programs.
The joint program reduces the usual pattern of a four-year PharmD program and a two-year MPH program by one year. Each candidate must meet all the degree requirements of each school, except for the reduction in total credit hours.
MPH Curriculum
In your third year, complete the majority of your MPH coursework for the Community Health and Health Behavior concentration, Epidemiology concentration, Health Services Administration concentration, or an Individualized (tailorable) concentration.
