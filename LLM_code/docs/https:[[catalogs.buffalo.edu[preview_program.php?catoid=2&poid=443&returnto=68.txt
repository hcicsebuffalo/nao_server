Educational Psychology and Quantitative Methods PhD
The Educational Psychology and Quantitative Methods program focuses on preparing students to address problems in diverse educational settings, with the ultimate goal of improving teaching and learning, classroom and school organization, inequities in opportunities to learn, the assessment of educational outcomes, and a range of other pressing educational issues. Educational psychologists have a common philosophy that we learn about educational processes, and ultimately improve them through the collection and study of empirical research data. Our program includes the study of human development, cognition and motivational processes.
