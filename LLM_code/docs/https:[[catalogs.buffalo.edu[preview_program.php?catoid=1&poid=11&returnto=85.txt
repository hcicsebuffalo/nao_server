Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Academic Requirements
Students must successfully complete the seven prerequisite courses to be permitted to take the required courses for the major and meet the stated minimum admission requirements (minimum B grades in MGA 201 and MGA 202, 3.000 prerequisite GPA, 3.000 UB GPA, 3.000 overall GPA, and 60 earned credit hours). If a course is repeated, the School of Management will only look at the grade earned the second time, even if the grade is lower than the grade earned the first time. Students may not enroll in any major-related course (including prerequisites) for a third attempt.
C or better grades are required in MGA 301, MGA 311, MGA 302, and MGA 312  to continue to the 400 level accounting courses. 
After beginning the required courses for the major, students must maintain a minimum UB and Major GPA of 2.000 and successfully complete all degree requirements for degree conferral. Please be aware that admission to graduate programs will require a much higher GPA.
A BS degree in accounting does not qualify students to sit for the CPA exam. Students interested in the CPA should visit the NYS CPA website to investigate MS programs that meet the 150 credit hour requirement. If you are an undergraduate accounting major and you wish to enhance your technical and professional skills through completion of an advanced degree in accounting or plan to pursue licensure as a certified public accountant (CPA), our Master of Science in Accounting is for you.
Transfer Credit Policy
Courses at the upper division (300 and 400 level) must be taken from other four-year AACSB Accredited Institutions. Accounting majors are expected to complete all required accounting program courses at the University at Buffalo. The Accounting Department will consider a request to complete one required accounting course at another four-year AACSB International accredited institution. Consult with your academic advisor about any plans to take courses outside of UB.
Program Honors
Third-years with exemplary first and second-year records and high promise for leadership and independent study, may be eligible for the School of Management honors program. Students must have an overall GPA of at least 3.500 to be eligible to apply. Admitted students complete 9 additional credit hours of coursework over three semesters, including MGB 359, 6  “Flex Credits”, MGB 360, MGB 361, and must take the designated honors section of MGO 403. Students must also meet the remaining criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. Students who successfully complete the honors program and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript.
Curricular Plan
A Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time.

Learning Outcomes
The University at Buffalo School of Management Undergraduate Programs are committed to making a difference in the lives of our students, guided by a culture of responsibility and mutual respect. Learning outcomes for the program are determined and continuously updated through discussion with the faculty group responsible for delivery of the courses in the program, as well as external stakeholders of the program, such as the Accounting Advisory Council of the department and recruiters of our students. In this program, students will develop proficiency in four key skill areas:
recording, analyzing and interpreting information for external and internal use
risk assessment, audit processes and responsibilities of accountants
management and assessment of data and information technology
tax principles, strategy and compliance
Upon the completion of this program, students will be able to apply critical thinking skills, ethical standards and relevant accounting principles to unstructured problems. Students will also be able to communicate effectively in professional accounting settings.
