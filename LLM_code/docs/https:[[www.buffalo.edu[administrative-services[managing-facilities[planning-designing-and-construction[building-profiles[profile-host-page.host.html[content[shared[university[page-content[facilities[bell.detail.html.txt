Lawrence D. Bell (1894-1956) developed the Bell Helicopter and founded Bell Aerosystems. In 1944 Lawrence Bell received the Daniel Guggenheim Medal for "achievement in design and construction of military aircraft and for outstanding contributions to the method of construction". In 1948 he was co-recipient of the coveted Collier Trophy for the design, development, and production of the X-1, the world's first supersonic airplane. The Bell Foundation provides an endowed chair in his name in the Department of Philosophy and a general purpose fund in the School of Engineering.
