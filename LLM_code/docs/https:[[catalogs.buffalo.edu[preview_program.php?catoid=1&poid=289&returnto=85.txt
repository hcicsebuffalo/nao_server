Nutrition Science BS
When you understand what we eat-and how it can influence our health and other parts of our lives-you can start to influence change. This major is for students whose interests go beyond having a passion for food and cooking, and instead want to focus on nutrition as a science. It’s a program designed for people who like biology and chemistry, and are looking for a degree that can help them stand apart in a wide variety of fields. Whether you want to help people one-on-one or find ways to improve the health of entire communities, this is the place to start.

Academic Requirements
Minimum major GPA of 2.000 is required. The Nutrition Science major GPA includes all required Nutrition Science coursework in the major and is a cumulative GPA. The student’s HUB Academic Advisement Report includes the Nutrition Science major GPA.
Students must maintain a 2.00 GPA in required coursework each semester. All students will be monitored each semester to ensure that they are making satisfactory academic progress in the major. Failure to maintain a cumulative UB GPA or Nutrition Science major GPA ≥ 2.000 will result in the student receiving warnings, mandatory advising, and the required completion of an academic workshop. Students who fail to maintain a cumulative UB GPA or Nutrition Science major GPA ≥ 2.000 for three consecutive semesters will be removed from the major.
Academic reviews are conducted following Fall and Spring semesters only. Courses repeated during the winter and/or summer are not factored into the review. Students must pass all required courses with a D or higher. A student who has been dismissed is not eligible for readmission into the major.
Program Distinction
A student in this major is eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met. Criteria are found under Academic Honors in the Policy and Procedure section of this Catalog. Program Distinction is noted on the official transcript.

Learning Outcomes
The Nutrition Science BS will prepare students for a variety of career pathways, including dietetics, food science, and for entry into health profession programs.
Upon successful completion of all requirements, the student will be able to:
Prepare students for careers or advanced degrees in nutrition, dietetics, public health, or health professions disciplines.
Teach students the role of nutrition in health and wellbeing of individuals, communities, and the world.
Develop students’ analytical, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills to foster an appreciation of current nutrition research and the need for evidence-based practice.
Provide a flexible degree program that is grounded in nutrition science, but allows students to customize their curriculum based on their interests, future educational goals, and career path.
Foster a sense of connection and engagement with the university, the school and the department that extends beyond graduation.
Promote a culture of inclusion, respect and collaboration by teaching students the impacts of economic, racial, ethnic, cultural, and global impacts of nutrition on health and well-being.
