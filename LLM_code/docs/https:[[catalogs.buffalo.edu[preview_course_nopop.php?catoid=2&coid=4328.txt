AAP 501SEM - Why Manage the Arts?
This course asks the question ¿Why Manage the Arts?¿ by looking at the complex relations between arts and management and by drawing upon arts management theory and practice. It is intended to provide a case study approach to the investigation of complex managerial problems in the subject. It rests on the premise that in order to create a successful arts¿ organization students need to have a good working knowledge of both the history of how the arts have been managed and what elements are significant in that history as well as an ability to compare and contrast different management models. This course aims to achieve both these outcomes, creating a well rounded understanding of the ways in which the arts have been managed in society in order to find solutions for today and the future.
