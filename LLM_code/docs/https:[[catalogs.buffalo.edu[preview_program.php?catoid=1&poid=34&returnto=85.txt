Biomedical Sciences BS
If you want a flexible major that helps prepare you for medical school or dental school-or you’re thinking about a career (or graduate school) in something related to bio and medicine-you’re in the right place. UB’s biomedical sciences program is for students who love biology and want to learn from experts in lots of different areas. As one of our students said, “It gives you a path to go down, but it’s not overly strict.” Sound interesting? Keep reading.
Visit the Biomedical Sciences academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Biomedical Sciences department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
Admission Criteria
Minimum 2.800 UB GPA overall
Minimum 3.000 major GPA required
