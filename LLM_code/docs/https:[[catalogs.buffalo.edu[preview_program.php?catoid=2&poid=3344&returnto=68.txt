Management MS
The MS in Management program is designed to meet the needs of those who would like to “speak the language of business” but do not hold a bachelor’s degree in business. This program will allow students from a variety of undergraduate backgrounds to develop fundamental knowledge of business operations, finance, marketing and strategy. While gaining exposure to the main areas of business, students will also develop their communication and leadership skills, and broaden their mindsets by taking electives alongside their peers from across the School of Management’s graduate degree portfolio.
