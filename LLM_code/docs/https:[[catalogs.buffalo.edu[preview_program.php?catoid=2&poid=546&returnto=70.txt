Medical Physics PhD
The medical physics graduate program leads to an MS and/or PhD degree, through the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, in association with the Department of Radiology. The program’s goal is to provide a sound academic foundation and practical experience for those planning to pursue a career in research, teaching or clinical medical physics, in either of the sub-specialty areas of medical imaging physics, therapeutic radiation physics, or nuclear medicine physics. Graduates are prepared for careers in these subspecialties or the continuation of their education in a postgraduate or residency program.

PhD Program Requirements
Credit Hours
A total of at least 72 credit hours are required for the PhD degree. Of this total, at least 30 credit hours must be earned in formal didactic coursework (including letter-graded Independent Study), as well as including 4 credit hours in Seminar plus at least 2 credit hours Medical Physics Practicum (at least 1 in each of imaging and therapy physics); excluded are Research, Thesis Guidance, Supervised Teaching, and (unless receiving a priori approval under special circumstances) pass/fail Independent Study courses. Where appropriate, didactic course credits may be transferred from other graduate programs.
