Architecture MArch/Urban Planning MUP
Architects and planners design physical environments and systems with which people interact every day. Direct, tangible engagement with this “material”-whether it be structural steel, streetscapes or citizen activists-is fundamental to aspiring architects and planners. This learn-by-doing approach to professional education is the crux of the program. From the studio to the community, UB students and faculty constantly “do” and “make” through applied research, built works, and creative activities. Here in Buffalo, design inquiry becomes design-build while planning concepts become adopted plans for communities.
