Biophysics PhD
The biophysics program studies normal and abnormal protein structure and function-particularly membrane channel proteins-as well as the normal and abnormal function of cells, organs, and intact animals and humans, using state-of-the-art biophysical, computational, genomic, proteomic, and physiological techniques. There is special emphasis on the biophysical properties of the neural, cardiac and respiratory systems. The graduate program is known for the excellence of its research faculty and flexibility of the program.
