AHI 590SEM - Methods of Art History (VS)
This course models various methods for interpreting 20th century visuality. As such, it is primarily concerned with a range of approaches to the interpretation of visual materials, with a distinct emphasis on modern and contemporary art. Its subject is thus what is often termed ¿theory,¿ but since I have been unable to think about theory in the abstract, we will ¿do¿ theory in conjunction with both actual visual material and a broader, enveloping social history. This is necessary both to offer theory a model for its deployment and to frame any given theory through its own social and cultural investments.
