Art History BA
If you want to understand culture and history, start with art. As an art history student, you’ll dive into the visual arts-from paintings and photographs to architecture and digital media-to discover extraordinary insights about people and society. You’ll learn how to be a detective, a historian, an explorer and a decoder of the world around us. In an increasingly visual world, you will become a trusted guide, equipped with the skills to see how we reveal ourselves through art.
Visit the Art History academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
