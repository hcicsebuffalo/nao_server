Linguistics PhD
The University at Buffalo’s Linguistics Department offers a comprehensive program covering the major areas of linguistics: phonetics, phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax and discourse/pragmatics. Our faculty focuses on the interface between language and cognition, empirically grounded linguistic theory, and both cross-linguistic studies and in-depth studies of individual languages other than English.

Degree Requirements
Core Courses
(Students with substantial prior preparation in linguistics choose one core course in each of the areas of: (1) Phonetics/Phonology;(2) Morphosyntax; (3) Semantics - plus a fourth course in their desired area of specialization; students without substantial prior preparation take two core courses in each area.)
LIN 531LEC - Phonetics Credits: 3
LIN 532LEC - Phonology 1 Credits: 3
LIN 538LEC - Semantics Credits: 3
LIN 543LEC - Semantics 2 Credits: 3

Three additional courses outside the student’s area of specialization
Methods Courses*
Two Methods Courses, either:
two semesters of Field Methods
OR two semesters of Quantitative Methods; Computational Linguistics; Corpus Linguistics
OR two semesters of Advanced Statistical Methods
Electives
Additional 500- or 600-level regular courses offered by the Department of Linguistics
Areas of Specialization
PhD students are required to take four courses in their main specialty (including relevant core and methods courses), and are expected to choose their two methods courses in accordance with their specialization. Students need not choose their area of specialization early in their graduate career; faculty only expect that students take these four courses by the time they finish their course work (i.e., complete their 72 credit hours).
Students admitted to the PhD track who decide, during the first or second year, that they no longer wish to pursue a PhD, may instead complete the course requirements for the MA specialization and take the MA exam.
