Orthodontics MS
Two advanced dental education programs are offered through the Department of Orthodontics. The programs, although not mutually exclusive, have different professional and educational objectives. The first of these is a 36-month clinical program that fulfills the educational requirements of the American Association of Orthodontics. In conjunction with the certificate program, a mandatory Master of Science in Orthodontics is pursued with clinical training. Residents earn a Certificate of Advanced Study in Orthodontics and a Master of Science degree upon completion.
