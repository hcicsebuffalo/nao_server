Media Arts and Sciences MS
This program is ideal for students who wish to explore the intersection of the quantitative procedures of STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and the qualitative practices of art and design. We combine design thinking with engineering procedures to address challenges that span multiple problem domains. Graduates will be well suited for positions in design, usability, and user-facing engineering as well as the increasingly prevalent number of computational- and media-focused PhD programs emphasizing a combination of theoretical and practical application.
