History PhD
The Department of History offers intense academic training in a supportive, close-knit, open-minded environment. The department has particular strength in Early Modern Societies, Race, Empire, and Nation, The Twentieth Century World, and Medicine, Disability and Science, but its small size also encourages contacts across standard disciplinary boundaries. Our students are doing research in the history of the Atlantic world, disability studies, public history, immigration history, gay and lesbian studies, and other emerging fields. Our graduates hold positions in universities, museums and libraries across the country.
