Urban Planning MUP/JD
The two-year Master of Urban Planning degree provides students with the knowledge, skills and experience to become a professional planner. The MUP program is built around a core curriculum, general electives, a planning studio, a departmental colloquium, and a culminating professional project or thesis. Our program is fully accredited by the Planning Accreditation Board. Graduates of our program find diverse job opportunities in government agencies, international agencies, development authorities, nonprofit organizations, community groups, land development firms and consulting companies.

Curriculum
Year 1 and 2
Students take a full foundational curriculum in each program (e.g., a year of law followed by a year of urban and regional planning or vice versa).  Students take a leave of absence from the program in which they are non-resident during these years. By the third semester of study, all MUP students, including dual degree students, must either declare an option to pursue one of our specialization options.
Year 3 and 4
Students combine law and urban and regional planning, mixing courses from both schools to complete the curriculum.  Students enroll in a full-year law clinic in year three concurrent with an MUP/JD colloquium. In the fourth year, students enroll in a graduate planning studio and Law Seminar, and complete degree requirements toward the dual degrees. Students may choose to tailor their elective choices to concentrate studies in a cross-professional topic area, such as land use and environmental law/planning; housing and community development law/planning; international law/planning; or state and local governance. Courses marked with an asterisk in the matrix count as credits toward both degree programs.
Students in the dual program may further choose to concentrate their elective choices in one or more optional areas of concentration, such as land use and environmental law/planning; housing and community development; state and local governance; international law/planning; or another area designed by the student. Sample course offerings in these areas follow, for illustrative purposes only. Course selections may also include relevant law clinics, law seminars, planning studios, and other electives.

Law and Urban Planning
Law and urban planning intersect in numerous ways academically and professionally.Common ground includes issues of land development; property; regulatory systems (such as zoning, environmental controls, and other municipal, state or federal regulations); community development; environmental law and policy; housing and business development. 
By permitting some elective courses to count toward both degrees, the JD/MUP program enables students to complete the two degrees in four years rather than the five years required to complete the programs separately. The program offers considerable curricular flexibility enabling students to custom design a dual professional degree matching their interests and career aspirations.
