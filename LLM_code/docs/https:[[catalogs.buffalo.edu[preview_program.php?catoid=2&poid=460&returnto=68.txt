English for Speakers of Other Languages EdM
The teacher education program offers a curricular option that leads to an EdM degree from the University at Buffalo, and a recommendation for initial and/or professional teacher certificates in English for speakers of other languages (ESOL). Teacher certification in ESOL allows one to teach in public, PreK through grade 12 schools in New York State; plus, other states, as well as schools in other countries, often hire program completers from the University at Buffalo. Therefore, this degree and the associated certification are marketable throughout New York State, nationally and internationally.
