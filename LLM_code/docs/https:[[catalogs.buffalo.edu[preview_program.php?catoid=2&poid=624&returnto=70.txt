Curriculum
At all stages of the program, students will work closely with a faculty advisor to tailor their course of study to their particular research interests. Students will be advised and encouraged to prepare manuscripts for publication while in the program as well as present their work in the doctoral research seminar and at national and international conferences. An endowment in the School of Architecture and Planning provides doctoral candidates a chance to network with and receive mentoring from the Clarkson Chair, a distinguished visiting planning scholar in the school.
Other UB departments where doctoral students may take courses include but are not limited to Anthropology, Architecture, Biostatistics, Education, Economics, Geography, Public Health, and Sociology. A list of potential courses available for each stream within the department and university is available from the Doctoral Program Director. All courses must be approved by the Doctoral Program Director.
Doctoral students must satisfy a teaching requirement which entails completion of a teaching internship such as a teaching assistantship for a course. Under certain circumstances, students may show equivalent pedagogical work such as prior teaching experience, or, completed prior training or a degree in education.
Basic Courses (24 credits)
Core and elective courses include those that would typically count toward a Master’s in Urban and Regional Planning program (18 core and 6 electives). Students with a prior urban planning degree may be permitted to transfer basic credits from another program or another university toward the basic course credits in the doctoral program.

Students will take at least two courses in a related minor field of study.
Doctoral Seminar
Students will participate in a doctoral seminar to present their own research as well as learn about latest research from faculty and scholars from within and outside of UB. In addition, students complete nine credits of directed research related to their dissertation. Prior to beginning work on their dissertation, students are expected to complete three qualifying exams - in theory, methods, and a content area - and defend their dissertation proposal. Students must complete the theory and methods qualifying exams within two years of enrollment in the program.
