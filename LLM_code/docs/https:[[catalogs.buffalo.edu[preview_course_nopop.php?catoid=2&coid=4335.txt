AAP 508SEM - Arts/Cul Pol & Diplomacy
The course introduces the subject of cultural policy as a form of public policy and surveys theoretical concepts and approaches to the policy dimensions of art and culture. It is organized around two questions. What is the role of a public government, and supranational political bodies in the regulation of arts and culture? What agencies, laws, and public policies have been put in place to regulate the arts and to what ends? The aim of the course is threefold. It offers an understanding of how the machinery of cultural policy works. It engages with theories about culture, state, governmentality, ideology and creativity. And finally, it surveys historical and contemporary forms of cultural policy, their aims and intended or unintended consequences. Students will consider theoretical ideas and how they affect attitudes toward culture and cultural policy, explore and investigate case studies, and devise a policy brief for a concrete existing issue in the field of arts and culture.
