Dance BA
Do you love that feeling when your body moves perfectly across the stage or studio? Do you stay awake at night thinking about how to choreograph routines? Do you want to spend your life performing, directing or teaching dance? 
If so, then majoring in dance might be right for you. It’s a program that will keep you on your toes-both literally and metaphorically. So if you want a lifetime of doing what you love (with people who love it as much as you do), then it’s time to take the next step.
