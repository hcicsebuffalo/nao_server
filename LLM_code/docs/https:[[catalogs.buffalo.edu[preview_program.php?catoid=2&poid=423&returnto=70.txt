Curriculum, Instruction and the Science of Learning PhD
The Curriculum, Instruction and the Science of Learning (CISL) PhD program is a multidisciplinary doctoral degree that focuses on addressing practical educational problems through research in diverse contexts for learning and teaching. While educational programs in curriculum and instruction are common, our program stands out by emphasizing the science of learning, a 21st century approach to developing evidenced-based practice through design research. In design research, we implement innovative practice/curriculum, study the effects and improve the implementation for further study.
