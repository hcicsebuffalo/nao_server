Bioinformatics and Computational Biology BS - Computer Science and Engineering Concentration
Use electronic health records to prevent future pandemics. Help analyze genetic data to develop new cancer drugs. Create advanced computer models that lead to more resilient ecosystems. If these things sound interesting to you-and if you like using science, math, data and statistics-then this program could be exactly what you’re looking for. This program is for students who want a highly interdisciplinary major, with the freedom to focus on biology, computer science or informatics (using data to improve health).
Visit the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Computer Science and Engineering department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.

Academic Requirements
Students seeking an undergraduate degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must have a minimum GPA of 2.000 in technical classes (engineering, math, and science classes). To maintain academic standards and determine eligibility for continued enrollment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences reviews the academic records of all students in an approved undergraduate SEAS major. This academic review is conducted at the end of each fall and spring semester.
View the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Academic Review Policy.
