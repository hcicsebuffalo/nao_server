Media Study PhD
Our PhD program is one of a small set of innovative doctoral programs in experimental and practice-led research in the Media Arts in the United States. This program offers a space for the development of artist-scholar-researchers whose hybrid making and writing practices respond and contribute to the development and transformation of media, art, technology, and culture. Students in this program develop a set of conceptual and technical abilities that allow them to engage with the aesthetic, political, and social challenges and debates surrounding media making and scholarship. A Media Study PhD requires both a written Dissertation and Media Project for conferral. Appropriate for artists who aim to conduct their research in an academic context, this PhD is equally appropriate for scholars who want to expand their capabilities as artists and makers. Combining professional rigor with highly individualized mentorship, our graduate program prepares students to become innovative artists, scholars, and teachers of media analysis, production, and theory. This program is designed to be completed in five years.
