Microbiology and Immunology MS
Graduate training in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, provides education and research opportunities in each of our four core disciplines: bacterial pathogenesis, eukaryotic pathogenesis (parasitology and mycology), virology, and immunology. Research in these disciplines utilizes the latest tools in biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology and biophysics, to probe the interactions of microbes with their human hosts with the ultimate goal of reducing the public health impact of infectious diseases. Our broad curriculum and focused research training prepares students to succeed in nearly any area of microbiology and immunology.
