AAP 525LEC - Grant Writing
This course will cover all areas of grant writing, from research for possible sources of funding, to writing and rewriting proposals to fit the interests and requirements of a potential funder, to budgets, and conversations with foundation staff and directors and community organizations. It will cover both writing for individual research projects and writing for community and institutional grants large and small. The course will require that enrolled students identify and prepare materials for at least one kind of grant, with the expectation that a draft proposal be submitted at the end of the semester. Students may work individually or with community or institutional partners in designing the project for which they seek funding, and they may choose to write a proposal that serves a community organization/institution, but the proposal work must be their own.
