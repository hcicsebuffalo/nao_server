Over 1,000 participants, mentors, volunteers and sponsors took part in the annual, three-day hackathon in April at the University of California, Los Angeles. The Cohere Company Challenge—sponsored by Cohere, a company that works to help businesses incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into their products and services—tasked students with developing a product using the company’s AI models. 
As part of a four-person team with students from other universities, Vadecha helped design GPTeddy, a teddy bear outfitted with a microphone, speaker and various software that allows the toy to speak with children and parents to regulate conversations. The device could provide an accessible solution for families seeking toys that offer a personalized learning experience. A demo and description of GPTeddy is available online. 
At UB, Vadecha conducts research in X-Lab under Jinjun Xiong, SUNY Empire Innovation Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He is pursuing a master’s degree in computer science and engineering.
UB is actively monitoring developments related to COVID-19. Please check with event organizers for the most up-to-date information about scheduled events.
