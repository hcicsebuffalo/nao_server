Our Campuses
University at Buffalo students live and learn on three very different but complementary campuses: the North Campus, in a bustling, inner-ring suburb; the South Campus, in a historic urban neighborhood; and the Downtown Campus, in Buffalo’s dynamic medical corridor.

Our Academic Heart
UB’s North Campus, located just outside the city in Amherst, N.Y., is where most of the university’s core academic programs are offered. Opened in the early 1970s, it is the largest of our three campuses, encompassing cutting-edge academic and research spaces, student residence halls and apartments, award-winning dining facilities, the Student Union and athletic venues. Abundant green spaces, including a recreational lake and a 65-acre living woods, complement the built environment.

A Historic Gem
UB’s South Campus is a Western New York landmark dating back to the 1920s. Situated in a leafy residential neighborhood in North Buffalo, the 153-acre parcel is home to classic ivy-covered buildings and grassy, tree-filled quads along with high-rise residence halls and innovative research and teaching facilities. The schools of Architecture and Planning, Dental Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Public Health and Health Professions are all located here.

Rising Biomedical Hub
The pillar of our Downtown Campus is the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, which moved there in 2017 following construction of a state-of-the-art building at Main and High streets. Most of our other Downtown Campus entities—including the New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences, the Clinical and Research Institute on Addictions, and the Clinical and Translational Research Center—are located near the Jacobs School in Buffalo’s medical corridor, a quickly growing hub of clinical care, research and education.
