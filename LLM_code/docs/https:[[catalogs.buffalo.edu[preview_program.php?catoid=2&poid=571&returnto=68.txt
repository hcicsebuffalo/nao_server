Nursing Post-BS to PhD
The Post-BS to PhD program at the University at Buffalo School of Nursing equips baccalaureate-prepared nurses to pursue a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in nursing. The Nursing PhD program prepares nurse scientists to: generate new knowledge and theory; extend the evidence-base of nursing and other disciplines; and disseminate this knowledge in their roles as researchers, academics and leaders, to affect change in policy, practice, and the profession of nursing. All doctoral classes are scheduled just two days per week, in order to accommodate the working student. The program is offered in a distance-accessible format using synchronously and asynchronously type format.
