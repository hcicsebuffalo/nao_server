Engineering Science MS: Internet of Things Focus
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical objects, including devices, vehicles, buildings, and various items, that are equipped with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity. This enables these objects to gather and exchange data. The Engineering Science MS program with a focus on IoT, is tailored to address the growing demand from employers seeking experts who can engineer innovative interactive services, handle data acquisition, fusion, and processing from sensors, actuators, controllers, and other devices, and design architectures to connect these components as part of more extensive and diverse systems.
In this rapidly evolving field, potential career opportunities span industry sectors such as energy, healthcare, transportation, infrastructure, and manufacturing. Students in this program will receive comprehensive training in various IoT technologies and develop skills and advanced knowledge in areas like data analytics, IoT architecture, and distributed application development.
