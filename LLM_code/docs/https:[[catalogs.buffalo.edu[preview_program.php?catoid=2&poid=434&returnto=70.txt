Econometrics and Quantitative Economics MS
The Econometrics and Qualitative Economics MS program provides the skills required of a quantitative economist seeking employment in the private profit and non-profit sectors, as well as in the government, and NGO sectors. The program focuses on mathematical and statistical theories that prepare our students to perform a wide gamut of business research, including cost-benefit analysis, researching market trends and forecasting future changes in economic activity in various sectors of the economy. Our students deal with large data sets related to financial, international and experimental issues, and branch out into areas like health and hi-tech research requiring econometric tools.
