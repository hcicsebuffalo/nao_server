Biological Sciences PhD
We offer graduate training in a rigorous yet supportive environment. Research in the Department of Biological Sciences examines levels of biological complexity from molecules to populations, with three areas of focus in molecular biology of gene expression, signal transduction in sensory perception and development, and evolutionary genomics and population biology. The curriculum develops critical thinking as well as written and oral communication skills. Students receive personal attention from their advisors. Three distinct degree programs are designed to prepare students for their chosen career in research, biology education, biotech and pharmaceutical industries, or health areas.
