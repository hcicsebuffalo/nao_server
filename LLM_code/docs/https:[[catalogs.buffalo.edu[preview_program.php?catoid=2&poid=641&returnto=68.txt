Social Studies Education: Adolescence EdM
The EdM program in social studies education is designed for people who are currently teaching, or who intend to teach, in elementary or secondary schools, and prepares students for New York State certification. The program examines major issues in social studies education, as well as ways of enhancing classroom practice. Students who have initial certification at the adolescence level can elect for an EdM, which qualifies them for professional certification at the middle school and adolescence levels. In addition, students in programs in early childhood or childhood education may choose to concentrate in social studies.
