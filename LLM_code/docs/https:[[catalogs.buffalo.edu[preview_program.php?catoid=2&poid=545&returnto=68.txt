Medical Physics MS
The medical physics graduate program leads to an MS and/or PhD degree, through the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, in association with the Department of Radiology. The program’s goal is to provide a sound academic foundation and practical experience for those planning to pursue a career in research, teaching or clinical medical physics, in either of the sub-specialty areas of medical imaging physics, therapeutic radiation physics, or nuclear medicine physics. Graduates are prepared for careers in these subspecialties or the continuation of their education in a postgraduate or residency program.
