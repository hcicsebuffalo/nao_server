Comparative Literature PhD
The Department of Comparative Literature is a small department whose distinctiveness lies in fostering students’ originality and independent intellectual inquiries. Its core identity consists in the theoretical studies of literature, politics and culture. The department stresses philosophical and theoretical graduate studies in the humanities, and is best known for its interdisciplinary work in post-Kantian philosophy, poststructuralism, and literatures of the 18th through 21st centuries. The cutting-edge, theoretical-philosophical approaches frame the various fields in our department’s research and teaching.

Coursework
Since the department affords a variety of general fields of study, the selection of courses will be determined by the student’s specific area of research. A minimum of ten courses will be required for the PhD. Supervised reading courses with individual faculty are not considered in fulfillment of this requirement. At least five courses must be “core” COL courses-that is, they must be taught by COL faculty. Cross-listed courses taught by affiliated faculty do not count toward those “core” five. The proportion of literary to theoretical and interdisciplinary courses will be determined in consultation with faculty advisers, subject to the approval of the director of graduate studies.
