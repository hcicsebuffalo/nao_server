Philosophy MA
The Department of Philosophy offers graduate study in a variety of subfields, with notable strengths in two areas of cross-disciplinary research that apply philosophical ideas and methods in the real world. The first is applied ontology, which links philosophical ideas and methods to the use of computers in managing data, for example in medical research or in intelligence analysis. The Department is the world’s center for the academic study of theoretical and applied ontology. A second area where the Department has particular strengths is in the growing field of philosophy, politics, and economics, which studies how the economy, political and social institutions, and questions of justice interact and draws on analytical tools and models from a range of disciplines to address pressing social problems. The Department also excels in philosophy of science, bioethics, and early modern philosophy. The Department is distinguished by its high-quality teaching, robust faculty-student interaction within a vibrant academic community, and the successful placement of our graduates in both academic and extra-academic positions.
