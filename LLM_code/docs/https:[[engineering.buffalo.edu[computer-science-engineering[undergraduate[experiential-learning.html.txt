Experiential learning gives you substantial preparation to enter the scientific and engineering professions and helps you explore future career options.  Many program graduates credit these experiences with giving them a competitive advantage during job searches and a smoother transition to full-time employment.
The department and school place significant emphasis on real-world experience.  We invite you to participate in as many of these programs as you like.
CSE Experiential Learning Initiatives
Internships
You'll earn hands-on, real-world experience by taking internships at companies related to your major.
Pledge to Professionalism
Graduating seniors may participate in the Pledge to Professionalism ceremony, a rite of passage event that affirms their commitment to the professions they are about to join.
Professional and Student Organizations
We strongly encourage you to join one or more professional and student organizations.  These groups are supportive, collegial, and purpose-driven.  They're ideal environments to find new friends and build your professional network.
UB Hacking
UB Hacking is the University at Buffalo's official student-run hackathon. Students are invited to gather at our event to create cool and innovative projects within 24 hours and showcase their achievements. Just bring your laptop (and other personal hygiene products) and we'll prepare the food and swag for a memorable weekend!
Undergraduate Research
CSE offers undergraduates ample opportunities to engage in creative research, including the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program of the National Science Foundation (NSF).  Undergraduates may obtain academic course credit while acquiring valuable research experience under world-class faculty.
SEAS Experiential Learning Initiatives
Engineering Intramurals
An engineering intramural is any problem-based extracurricular engineering activity that provides an authentic (i.e., “real-world”) learning experience for students.
Engineering Senior Design Expo
The Engineering Senior Design Expo provides students with a chance to present their work to a broad audience inclusive of fellow students, faculty and industry partners.
Internships and Co-Ops
Students are eligible to earn academic credit for internships and co-ops that may fulfill degree requirements.
Shared Instrumentation Laboratories
UB’s Science and Engineering Equipment and Instrumentation Portal (EQUIP) of Shared Facilities provides cost-effective access to precision laboratories, tools and equipment for electronic device development, and the study and analysis of materials.
Tinkering
DREAM (formerly Tinkering) is the first step in the ELP continuum. Students pursue self-led, hands-on practice as a precursor to being involved in more significant activities.
