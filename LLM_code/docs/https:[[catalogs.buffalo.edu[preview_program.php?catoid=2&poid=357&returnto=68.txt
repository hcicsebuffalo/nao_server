Biological Sciences MA
The special master’s program (SMP) in Biological Sciences is a flexible graduate program that caters to students from many backgrounds, goals, and interests. In partnership with a faculty academic advisor, students create a fully customized curriculum which can include courses both within and outside of our department (including the School of Dental Medicine, School of Public Health and Health Sciences, and the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences). Students may pursue degree completion at their pace and are not required to be registered full time, which assists students who must complete intensive clinical shadowing opportunities, employment, or entrance exam preparation. All students must complete a research project under the instruction of a faculty member, however this project can be experimental, data analysis, or literature based, and can be completed in any department at UB.
The SMP has a roughly 75% success rate for its graduates getting accepted into their desired health-related programs, with many gaining acceptances to UB’s MD and DDS programs. The flexible nature of the program is also useful for students who are looking to explore career options across multiple disciplines, and for those who want to try graduate research before committing to a career or PhD track. Upon completion of the SMP, students receive an Master of Arts degree in Biological Sciences
