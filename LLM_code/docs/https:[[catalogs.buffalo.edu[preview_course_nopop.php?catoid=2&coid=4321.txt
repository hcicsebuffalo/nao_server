AAP 552LEC - Arts Marketing and Analysis
This course focuses on making a compelling and informed recommendation regarding a new business idea for a client through research approaches including market segmentation and surveys, total addressable markets, qualitative interviewing, financial reports, and persona profiling. These processes simulate the experience of building a professional relationship and crafting a narrative that connects to a data-informed recommendation. Students will select a role to support one of three phases of project work for the semester: Kick-Off Project Manager, Research and Insights, Delivery Project Manager. Leads will be responsible for all “check-ins” (deliverables) within their module and will be expected to lead other members of the agency to complete work.
