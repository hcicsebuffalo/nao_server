Law BA
If you enjoy analyzing arguments, like to think critically, and are interested in things like justice, social order and rights, this major might be for you. As a law major, you can get the lifelong benefits of studying the law (including some fascinating career opportunities) without the commitment of going to law school. It’s the perfect major for students who are interested in how law impacts our lives, but don’t necessarily want to be an attorney.
Visit the Law academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the School of Law page for contact information, a brief overview of the school and the curricular options.
