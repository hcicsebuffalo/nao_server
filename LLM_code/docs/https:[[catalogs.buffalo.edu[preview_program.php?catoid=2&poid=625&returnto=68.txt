Theatre and Performance PhD
The graduate programs in theatre and performance feature a unique integration of scholarship and practice. We believe that if you know something theoretically but don’t know it practically, then you don’t truly understand its whole theory. Conversely, if you know something practically but don’t know it theoretically, then you don’t truly understand its whole practice. This program is designed to foster scholar artists who are well versed in research, scholarship and performance practice.
