Structural Biology PhD
The focus of the Department of Structural Biology, is biological form and function at the level of the three-dimensional atomic architecture of biological macromolecules. A hallmark of the department is its thoroughness in teaching the principles and practice of the main methods of structural biology: protein production, purification and crystallization; x-ray diffraction crystallography; and computational structural modeling.

First-Year Curriculum
The doctoral degree requires a minimum of 72 credit hours earned from a combination of coursework taken in the first year of the PhD Program in Biomedical Sciences (PPBS) program and subsequent years in the department, along with four to five years of laboratory research in a faculty member’s research laboratory.
In the second year, you will study core courses in the methods of structural biology, and throughout your program of study you will take part in departmental seminars. By the beginning of their second year, you will choose a thesis or dissertation research topic and faculty adviser, and commence your degree research.
You are required to present and defend orally a written proposal for your research project for admission to degree candidacy.
The doctoral dissertation research must represent an original investigation designed to contribute to new knowledge and understanding of biomolecular form and function or new methodology for research in structural biology. It is expected that the research will normally lead to publication in prominent refereed journals of one or more research papers of which you are the principal author.
