Educational Culture, Policy and Society PhD
The Educational Culture, Policy and Society PhD program focuses on the role that education-including, but not limited to P-16-plays in the larger society. We pay special attention to institutions, policies and practices that facilitate individuals’ well-being, and social and economic outcomes, as well as those that limit them. We focus on the links between educational institutions and broader social, cultural, political and economic forces, particularly among underserved populations in the United States and in the global context. This includes historically marginalized racial/ethnic groups in the United States (e.g., African American, Latino/a, and non-proficient English speakers), and populations with limited financial resources.  The Educational Culture, Policy and Society PhD program also focuses on cross-national comparisons of educational policies and practices central to policymakers, and school leaders around the world. Students are trained in mixed methods research (quantitative and qualitative) to support broad-based research projects. Students will gain in-depth expertise in one methodology and fluency in the other methodology.
