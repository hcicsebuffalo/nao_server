ANA 605LAB - Advanced Human Dissection
This course will enable students, according to their particular needs, to perform a dissection of one particular region to a complete dissection of the human body, using either standard or special techniques of dissection and preparation. Faculty will be available initially to plan the dissection schedule and procedures, and will thereafter be available for consultation as needed. Some students may only wish an opportunity to personally dissect certain regions not assigned to them during the introductory course. Others may need more detailed study as a preparation for a contemplated career involving either a particular clinical specialty or teaching of gross human anatomy. Scheduled dissecting time, staff supervision, and course credit will be assigned accordingly. At the conclusion of this course, students will hopefully have acquired skills and experience in the techniques of dissection and preparation.
Credits: 1 - 4
