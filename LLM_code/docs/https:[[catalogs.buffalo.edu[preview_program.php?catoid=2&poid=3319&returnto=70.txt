Applied Economics - Health Services Specialization Advanced Certificate
Offered in collaboration with the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine in the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, economics of health services gives you an understanding of what influences health-care expenditures, how health-care services are currently rationed and financed, what alternative options exist; and how institutions that provide health-care products, services, and health insurance adapt to market and regulatory constraints. Our program offers a unique opportunity in the Buffalo area to train economic analysts in this relatively new and expanding discipline.
