Rehabilitation Counseling Advanced Certificate
Rehabilitation counseling is an exciting, rapidly growing profession, and UB’s program is one of the oldest and best of its kind in the United States. We are hands-on; the counseling skills and rehabilitation techniques learned in the classroom are practiced and evaluated in the field at rehabilitation agencies. Rehabilitation counseling graduates hold leadership positions around the country and work with the psychological, social, vocational, and educational problems of people disabled by physical, mental, emotional, or social conditions. In addition, this program is offered in an online format to those living outside the Buffalo, New York, area.
