Global Gender Studies PhD
Global gender studies offers today’s students courses in three clusters: cultures and identities, women and global citizenship, and gender and public policy. The courses within each concentration recognize developing trends in studies of gender issues in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe and the United States. Our objective is to link local and global knowledge, so as to prepare students with the capacity to link gender and history, literature and policy, and to be able to apply these to graduate work and practical employment.
