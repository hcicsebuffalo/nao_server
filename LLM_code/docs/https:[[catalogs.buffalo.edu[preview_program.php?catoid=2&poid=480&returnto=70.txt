Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics MS
The MS and PhD programs in Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics (GGB) prepare students to contribute to exciting new research essential to the success of 21st-century medicine, novel treatments and cures. The program is expressly designed to develop innovative and creative scientists, with an emphasis on the “how and why” of GGB research, and its broader significance to science and medicine. The GGB faculty-scientists engage graduate and doctoral students in cutting-edge research across diverse disciplines, directing approximately $20 million in research funding annually.
