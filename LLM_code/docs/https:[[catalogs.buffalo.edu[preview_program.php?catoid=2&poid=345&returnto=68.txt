Architecture MArch (3.5 Year Track)
A learn-by-doing approach to professional education is the crux of the program, at the only accredited school of architecture and planning in the SUNY system. From the studio to the community, students and faculty constantly “do” and “make” through applied research, built works and creative activities. Built on five graduate research groups: inclusive design, ecological practices, material culture, situated technologies and urban design, the graduate programs take advantage of the cutting-edge research being conducted at UB’s School of Architecture and Planning.
