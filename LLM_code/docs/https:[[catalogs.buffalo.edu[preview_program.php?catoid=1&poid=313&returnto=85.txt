Mechanical Engineering BS
Do you want to develop technologies that improve people’s lives? Do you care about things like helping people with health conditions, making transportation more sustainable and assisting those who live in poverty?
Mechanical engineering is one of the most flexible-and practical-degrees. It’s for people who want to know how different types of machines, engines and systems work so they can make them better. Whether you want to design self-driving cars, improve wind turbines, build life-saving robots-or find other ways to change the world by solving problems-let’s get started.
Visit the Mechanical Engineering academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.

Notes
*Students are permitted to take alternative programming courses EAS 240 or CSE 115 in lieu of EAS 230, however EAS 230 is strongly preferred for Mechanical Engineering majors. The alternative programming courses should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with EAS 240, CSE 115, or EAS 999TRCP (general programming for transfer students) already completed. View our Computer Programming Requirement website for more information on the programming alternatives and self-study packages.
**Students are permitted to use CIE 177 or EAS 999TR177 (general graphics for transfer students) to satisfy this requirement. However, MAE 177 is strongly preferred for Mechanical Engineering majors. The CIE 177 or EAS 999TR177 should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with these courses already completed. View our Graphics Requirement website for more information on graphics alternatives and self-study packages.
***Transfer students with Senior standing must replace MAE 277 with an SEAS technical elective. Transfer students with Junior standing should consult with an MAE academic adviser to determine if they should take MAE 277 or replace it with an SEAS technical elective.
****A maximum combined total of 6 credits from the following courses can be used to satisfy degree requirements: EAS496, MAE496, MAE498, MAE499.
*****Students are permitted to use PHY 151 and PHY 152 in lieu of PHY 158, however PHY 158 is preferred for engineering majors.
******Students cannot complete both EAS 305 or STA 301/MTH 411 as a degree requirement.
Academic Requirements
Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must have a minimum GPA of 2.000 in technical classes (engineering, math, and science classes) to be in good standing and graduate with an undergraduate degree.  To maintain academic standards and determine eligibility for continued enrollment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences reviews the academic records of all students in an approved undergraduate SEAS major. This academic review is conducted at the end of each fall and spring semester.
View the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Academic Review Policy
Transfer Credit Policy
Students seeking an undergraduate engineering degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must complete 30 undergraduate credit hours of junior/senior level courses required in their major at the University at Buffalo.
