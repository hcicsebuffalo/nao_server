Linguistics BA - Chinese Language and Linguistics Concentration
Speaking. Signing. Understanding. It’s all part of linguistics, a program designed for people who love words and languages -and want to use science to study how we communicate with each other. For example, are you curious why “the small brown dog” sounds right, but “the brown small dog” sounds wrong? Find out at UB, where you can also choose to specialize in some of the world’s most widely spoken languages, like Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
Visit the Linguistics academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.

Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of all requirements, the student will:
demonstrate a beginner-level understanding of the basic concepts associated with phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics and also apply basic analytical methods from each of these domains to analyze linguistic data.
demonstrate an intermediate-level understanding of key concepts in the study of sound systems and methods of phonetic and phonological analysis. Students will apply these methods and concepts to produce and transcribe speech sounds and analyze sound systems.
demonstrate an intermediate-level understanding of key concepts in the study of word and sentence structure and methods of morphological and syntactic analysis. Students will apply these methods and concepts to analyze word and sentence structure.
 identify ways that different kinds of meaning are encoded linguistically and apply multiple methods for analyzing meaning from a major subfield of linguistics such as semantics, sociolinguistics, or linguistic anthropology.
will apply tools from several domains of linguistic analysis to understand and analyze the linguistic patterns of a specific language.
