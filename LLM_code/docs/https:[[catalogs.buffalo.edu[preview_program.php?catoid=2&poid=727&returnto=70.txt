Feminism and Visual Literacy Micro-Credential
The micro-credential in Feminism and Visual Literacy provides learners with a unique opportunity to gain skills in analyzing visual material from a perspective of feminist and queer theories and methodologies. As consumers and producers of an increasingly visual world, visual literacy is an essential but often underdeveloped skill valuable in academic and professional settings. This program allows you to select from courses that benefit your research and professional trajectories, while also providing a foundation in feminist visual literacy.
