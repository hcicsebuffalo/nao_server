Economics PhD
Economics is a science that deals with the allocation of scarce resources to satisfy competing ends. It deals with choices that individuals, corporations, investors and governments make to maximize individual welfare, as well as with the way that efficient markets, trade, and exchange operate to enhance economic growth, and social welfare. Our internationally distinguished faculty provide our students knowledge that will help expand their employment and earning opportunities in the private and public sectors, and apply economic principles in their daily lives.
PhD Degree Guidelines
Upon entry, students are advised by the Director of Graduate Studies. During the third year, the major supervisor of the dissertation will become the student’s advisor
Credit Hours
The minimum credit hour requirement for the PhD track is 72 credit hours. Of these, a minimum of 36 credits must be earned in economics courses. The remaining 36 credit hours may be earned from graduate courses inside or outside the department and from Independent Study, Supervised Research or Thesis Guidance in Economics.
In selecting all outside courses, students must seek advice from their doctoral dissertation committees or from the Director of Graduate Studies (if such committees are not yet in place). Please note: Inappropriate outside course selection against advice may affect a student’s financial aid decision.
All students are expected to maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.0 (B) at all times.
