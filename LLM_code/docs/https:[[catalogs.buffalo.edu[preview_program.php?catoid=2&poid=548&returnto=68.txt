Medicinal Chemistry PhD
Having occupied a state-of-the-art building, merged the Departments of Chemistry and Medicinal Chemistry, and added several recent faculty, the research activity of the medicinal chemistry program is very energized. As a moderately large graduate program, we have the critical mass for the state-of-the-art instrumentation required for modern research in chemistry. Still, the program is sufficiently small to have a nurturing and supportive environment for all the students.
