Architecture MArch/Business Administration MBA
The establishment or management of a successful architectural office requires a wide range of skills. In addition to competence in traditional architectural roles, the growing complexity of the field demands a wide range of managerial and administrative skills. For instance, many architectural practices have expanded their range of services to include construction supervision, real estate development, multinational project management and public-sector consultation. The MArch/MBA dual degree is intended to provide students with the skills and knowledge necessary to assume responsibilities for these challenges.
The MBA is a valuable credential that can be paired with a number of professional degrees, offering advanced business training concurrently to students pursing professional credentials.  The School of Management offers 6 such “collaborative” offerings:  the MBA/AuD for speech pathologists, the MBA/Real Estate Development MS for planners and developers, the MBA/DDS for aspiring dentists, the MBA/MPH for public health professionals, and the MBA in combination with our surgical residency, for surgeons-in-training.  Contact the School of Management for more information about these time-saving “collaborative” program opportunities.
