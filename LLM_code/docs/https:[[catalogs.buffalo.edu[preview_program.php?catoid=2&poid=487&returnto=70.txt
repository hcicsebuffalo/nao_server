Geological Sciences PhD
The Department of Geological Sciences focuses on advancing our understanding of earth and applying that knowledge to problems of societal importance. Our faculty members apply interdisciplinary approaches to three main themes: (1) climate change, (2) geohazards, volcanology and geodynamics, and (3) water and environment. Graduate studies are aimed at preparing students for careers in the private sector, government research organizations and in academia. Students receive specialized training in their selected focus areas but also are exposed to the full breadth of the department’s expertise in order to provide balance and career flexibility.
