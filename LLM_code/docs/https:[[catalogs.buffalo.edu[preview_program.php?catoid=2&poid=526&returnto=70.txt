If research interests dictate, you may register for research seminars or other classes in related disciplines such as econometrics (e.g., ECO 712SEM - Econometrics: Time Series Analysis; ECO 713SEM - Advanced Econometrics I; ECO 796SEM - Special Topics), accounting (e.g. accounting research methodology, seminar in financial accounting), computer science (e.g. machine learning, big data, computing), industrial and systems engineering (e.g. simulations and stochastic models), etc. Some of these are subject to approval by your PhD advisor.
By the end of your second year, you will be required to present a full research paper of publishable quality. The Department of Finance uses the 2nd-year paper requirement in order to evaluate each student’s potential and ability to develop and execute research ideas independently. The evaluation of research potential/capabilities will be made by the Second-Year Paper Committee (hereafter ‘committee’). The committee is chosen by the student and should consist of at least two finance faculty members (including a committee chair and a committee member).
In the summer after the second year, you will be required to pass the comprehensive exam. The exam consists of two written parts and takes two days. On day one, you will be asked to answer questions inspired by the finance research classes you have taken. On the second day, you will be required to write a paper review for a hypothetical finance journal.

Third Year and Beyond
After passing the comprehensive exam, you will work closely with your faculty advisor toward the completion of your thesis. While you may continue to take regular classes, your focus will be on the quality of your research and its publishability.
