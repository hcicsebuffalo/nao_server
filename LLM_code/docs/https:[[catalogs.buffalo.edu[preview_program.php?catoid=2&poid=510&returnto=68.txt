Jewish Thought MA
The MA in Jewish Thought, a comprehensive, 30-credit program, provides advanced training in the intellectual and spiritual history of Judaism, with special emphasis on medieval, modern and contemporary thought. You will explore both classical and modern texts, and examine authors and philosophers who have an impact on the field. These authors and texts will be read closely to discover original ideas, the conceptual and historical relations of these ideas and thinkers to one another, and their relation to the broader intellectual issues of their times and our times.
