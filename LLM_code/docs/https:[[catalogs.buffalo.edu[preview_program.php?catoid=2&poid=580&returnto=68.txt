Oral Sciences MS
The Oral Sciences program in the School of Dental Medicine leads to a Master of Science degree. The curriculum provides opportunity for scholarship in areas particularly relevant to oral health and disease. Students may be simultaneously enrolled in a clinical advanced certificate program. An enhanced pre-professional curriculum is also available to students interested in applying to professional school (e.g., dental school) after completing the program. The scope of the enhanced curriculum is to strengthen the candidacy of prospective dental school applicants by preparing them for the rigors of dental school via coursework and research.
