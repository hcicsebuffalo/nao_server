Nuclear Medicine Technology BS
If using radioactive material to help people sounds like fun, then let’s talk about nuclear medicine technology. This major is for students who want to use nuclear technology to identify cancer and other diseases in their earliest stages, visualize what’s happening in the body at the cellular level, and provide patients with life-saving therapies. As one of our students said, “I wanted a health field major that required a lot of patient contact and clinical work-but also a lot of science skills.”
Visit the Nuclear Medicine Technology academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Nuclear Medicine department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
Admission Criteria
Minimum 2.000 GPA overall
Minimum 2.500 GPA in prerequisite science and mathematics courses
Current UB students who are interested in applying to the Nuclear Medicine Technology BS in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences should submit the Program Application.
