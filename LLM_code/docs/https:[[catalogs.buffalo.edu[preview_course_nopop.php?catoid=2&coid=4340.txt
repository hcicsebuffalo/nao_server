AAP 551LEC - Arts Business and Finance
How do you launch a brand? In this course, students learn the fundamentals by building one together. Content supports knowledge-building across a series of modules in a simulated creative marketing agency. Each student will select an area of expertise and lead related project work within that module. Regardless of area of expertise, each student will participate as either a lead or team member in all elements of the course. Early semester work focuses on developing the brand and building a strategy to establish a presence that drives awareness. Week-to-week assignments support the key components needed to launch. Topics for discussion include audience development, key financial considerations, competitive analysis, synthesizing primary research and industry insights, and other business and marketing fundamentals.
