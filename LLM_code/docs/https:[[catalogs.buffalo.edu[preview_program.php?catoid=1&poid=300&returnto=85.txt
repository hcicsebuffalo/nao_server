Material Science and Engineering BS
Your clothes. Your water bottle. The screen you’re looking at right now. They’re all made from materials.
Now imagine if you could make these materials stronger, safer and more sustainable. Sound interesting? Then this is the major for you.
Whether you want to design longer-lasting batteries, more comfortable contact lenses, or solar panels that can be made without toxic materials, this is where you start. It’s the perfect program for people who love chemistry and data-and want a major that can (literally) touch all of our lives.
Visit the Material Science and Engineering academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
