Neuroscience MS
The neuroscience program is an interdisciplinary undertaking of research and education, offering doctoral and master’s degrees. The program encompasses over 75 faculty members in clinical and basic science departments throughout the university. The goal is to provide maximal academic flexibility that matches the broad scope of modern neuroscience. The emphasis is on interactions between five main areas: cellular and molecular mechanisms of nervous system function and dysfunction, development and plasticity, sensory systems, behavioral neurobiology, and translational medicine in the nervous system.
