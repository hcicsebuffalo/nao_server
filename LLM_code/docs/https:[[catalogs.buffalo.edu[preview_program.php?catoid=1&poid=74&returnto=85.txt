Dance BFA
Do you love that feeling when your body moves perfectly across the stage or studio? Do you stay awake at night thinking about how to choreograph routines? Do you want to spend your life performing, directing or teaching dance? 
If so, then majoring in dance might be right for you. It’s a program that will keep you on your toes-both literally and metaphorically. So if you want a lifetime of doing what you love (with people who love it as much as you do), then it’s time to take the next step.
Visit the Dance academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Theatre and Dance department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
