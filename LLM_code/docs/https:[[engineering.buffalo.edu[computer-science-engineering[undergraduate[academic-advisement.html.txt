Academic Advisors
UB has three undergraduate academic advisement offices to help you succeed in your chosen CSE program.  This section will help you find the advisor who is best suited to help you at this particular moment in your academic career.
Phase 1: Advisement for UB Undergraduate Students Who Have Not Yet Satisfied SEAS Admissions Criteria
If you're a current UB undergraduate student and have not yet completed your SEAS Undergraduate Admission for Current UB Students criteria, you should seek academic advisement from the Exploratory and Pre-Professional Advising Center in 112 Capen Hall.
Go To Google Maps for directions and details
Phase 2: Advisement for UB Undergraduate Students Who Have Satisfied SEAS Admissions Criteria
After you have satisfied your SEAS Undergraduate Admission for Current UB Students criteria—but who have not yet been admitted to a CSE major— you should seek academic advisement from the SEAS Office of Undergraduate Education—Academic Advisement in 410 Bonner Hall.

Phase 3: Advisement for UB Undergraduate Students in Approved CSE Majors
Now that you're accepted into an approved CSE major, Shelly Neumaier, the CSE Undergraduate Advisor, will help advise you.
You may visit Shelly during business hours in her office, 338O Davis Hall.
CSE Program Flowsheets
These flowsheets show the recommended sequence of degree requirements for our different CSE programs. These interactive online versions will highlight pre-requisite and co-requisite courses to help identify which courses must be completed before moving forward. Details of the program and degree requirements are detailed in the Undergraduate Degree & Course Catalog.
These online tools can help you to plan out your courses at UB. Please note that these do not take the place of an advising appointment and do not guarantee completion of degree requirements.

Transfer Credits
Your HUB Academic Advisement Report shows you your student record—all the courses that you have taken at UB as well as any transfer credit.  If you are thinking of taking supplemental coursework at a different institution with the intention of transferring it to UB, first ensure that UB will accept it as transfer credit by checking TAURUS (before you register for it).
