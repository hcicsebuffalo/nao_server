AHI 588SEM - Dsplyng Gnder Mseum Exhbt
This course brings together two of the most significant strains of recent art historical scholarship: the study of gender in representation and the critical examination of exhibitions and museums. Focusing on key examples of curatorial practice from the late nineteenth century to the present day, students will be encouraged to think about femininities and masculinities on display as manifestations of gendered stereotypes and ideals. Through readings, museum visits, class discussions and guided individual research, questions of gender in exhibitions will be considered in relation to other aspects of identity including sexuality, race and cla.ss. In the course’s seminar setting, we will consider the ways in which public exhibitions function as sites of display for certain gendered norms and anxieties and as places for cultural and countercultural identities to make themselves visible.
