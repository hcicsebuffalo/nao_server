Sustainability Advanced Certificate
One of the fundamental societal issues of the 21st century is understanding the environment, how human interactions affect it, and how those interactions can be modulated to generate sustainable outcomes. Fundamental environmental and sustainability issues include: the ecological and evolutionary processes that control populations, species and communities; anthropogenic effects on the physical, chemical and biotic environments; and the cultural values and societal actions necessary to foster sustainable interactions with the natural world. Addressing these issues requires a transdisciplinary approach that spans the natural and social sciences. This advanced certificate will offer students a basic understanding of sustainability, including the environmental, social, and economic dimensions of the field.
