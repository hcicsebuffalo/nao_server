Rehabilitation Science MS
The MS program in Rehabilitation Science provides a rigorous curriculum that creates a foundation for research and evidence-based practice in the rehabilitation health fields. Students graduating from this program are prepared to enter PhD programs in Rehabilitation Science to develop further their roles as scientists, advanced practitioners, educators, and leaders. Students may choose to earn this degree as a pathway to career advancement in health care, both in the public and private sectors. Students will enhance their knowledge in research, education, and leadership as they develop their specialty in rehabilitation science.
This MS program in Rehabilitation Science serves as a stepping-stone into UB’s Rehabilitation Science PhD program, as well as a credentialing opportunity for professionals who need a Master’s degree to further their career. This Master’s program consists primarily of the core curriculum of UB’s PhD program in Rehabilitation Science and is offered with three culminating experience options (thesis, project, or exam) to accommodate students’ different goals. All three options are 36 credits and could take one and a half to two years full-time to complete.
