Philosophy BA
Philosophy trains your mind. As a philosophy major, you’ll get to ask the big questions about the nature of reality, beauty and justice-and study a rigorous methodology and analytical skills that are broadly applicable throughout your professional and personal life. Whether you’re thinking about graduate school (including law school or business school), or you want to get a job right after graduation, philosophy is a thoughtful choice that gives you flexibility.
Visit the Philosophy academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Philosophy department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
