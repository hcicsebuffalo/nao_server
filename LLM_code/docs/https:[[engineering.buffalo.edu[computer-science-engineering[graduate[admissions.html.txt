About the Authors
Introduction
The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) offers two graduate degrees:
PhD in Computer Science and Engineering
MS in Computer Science and Engineering
Admission
First-year students may be admitted into either the MS or the PhD program. Normally, students with a master's degree in computer science and engineering (and some other students upon the recommendation of the Graduate Admissions Committee) are admitted directly into the PhD program.
Advisor
Upon admission, you are assigned an advisor. This person is not necessarily your "major professor" for the MS project or thesis or the PhD dissertation (as defined for Masters Students or PhD Students). When you have come to an agreement with a major professor, that person will become your advisor as well. You may request a change of advisor at any time. All students and advisors are urged to meet at least once each semester to review the student's progress and course of study.
