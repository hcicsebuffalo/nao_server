Microbiology and Immunology PhD
Graduate training in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, provides education and research opportunities in each of our four core disciplines: bacterial pathogenesis, eukaryotic pathogenesis (parasitology and mycology), virology, and immunology. Research in these disciplines utilizes the latest tools in biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology and biophysics, to probe the interactions of microbes with their human hosts with the ultimate goal of reducing the public health impact of infectious diseases. Our broad curriculum and focused research training prepares students to succeed in nearly any area of microbiology and immunology.

Professional Development
We are committed to working with you to consistently develop your professional acumen. You will gain the knowledge and skills you need to succeed in our constantly evolving field. Through our department and the Witebsky Center for Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology, you will have opportunities to participate in significant research, presentation forums and seminars.
Our PhD candidates routinely generate high quality publications and move on to postdoctoral positions in top infectious disease laboratories.
Thesis Research
You conduct your thesis research under the supervision of your mentor and a PhD Thesis Advisory Committee. Your committee will include your mentor as chair and at least three other UB faculty members in the graduate school selected by you and your mentor.
Two members of your committee must have appointments in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, and one may have a primary appointment in another UB department.
Your research culminates in a written thesis dissertation, which is an original contribution to the scientific literature. You also must orally defend your thesis before your advisory committee. In addition, you will formally present your research during a public seminar.
On average, our PhD students complete degree requirements in about five years.
