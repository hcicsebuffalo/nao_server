Environmental Design BA
Look around you. From the building you live in to the bike path you take to school or work to the farmer’s market you visit to buy healthy food, the built environment touches every aspect of your life.
It is also closely tied to some of the most complex problems facing cities today, from climate change and community health to public safety and housing affordability.
If you’re interested in how the world around you takes shape-and you want to help communities create places that are not only beautiful, but also sustainable, healthy and equitable for generations to come-then environmental design could be the field for you.
Visit the Environmental Design academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Urban and Regional Planning department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
