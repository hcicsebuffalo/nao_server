Classics PhD
The Department of Classics includes programs in Greek and Latin Language and Literature, Greco-Roman History, and Classical Archaeology. Its faculty is renowned for scholarship in all of these areas and offers graduate training that combines specialization with foundations of considerable breadth. In the first year of study, students are given the opportunity to strengthen their command of the classical languages and to survey methods, content, and issues across the field as a whole. By the second year, students will further develop distinctive areas of interest in order to undertake independent investigations.
