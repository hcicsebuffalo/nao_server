Social Work MSW/MPH
The MSW/MPH program incorporates a public health perspective into social work practice to address health disparities and create change in individuals’ lives and health care policy. This collaborative program between the School of Public Health and Health Professions and School of Social Work enables students to earn both Master in Public Health (MPH) and Master of Social Work (MSW) degrees and reduces the amount of time and credits compared to completing both programs separately. The MSW/MPH program offers both traditional and advanced standing tracks and incorporates our signature trauma-informed and human rights perspectives.
