Academic Requirements
All ES students must maintain a 2.000 GPA in required course work each semester. All students will be monitored each semester to ensure that they are making satisfactory academic progress in the major. Failure to maintain a cumulative UB GPA or ES major GPA ≥ 2.000 will result in the student receiving academic warnings, mandatory advising, and required completion of an academic workshop. Students who fail to maintain a UB cumulative or ES major GPA ≥ 2.000 for three consecutive semesters will be removed from the major. Academic reviews are conducted following Fall and Spring semesters only. Courses repeated during the winter and/or summer are not factored into the review. Students must pass all required courses with a D or higher. A student who has been dismissed is not eligible for readmission into the major.
The ES major GPA includes all required ES coursework in the major and is a cumulative GPA. The student’s HUB Academic Advisement Report includes the ES major GPA.
Program Distinction
A student in this major is eligible for Program Distinction upon degree conferral if the criteria are met. Criteria are found under Academic Honors in the Policy and Procedure section of this Catalog. Program Distinction is noted on the official transcript.
Curricular Plan
A Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time.
