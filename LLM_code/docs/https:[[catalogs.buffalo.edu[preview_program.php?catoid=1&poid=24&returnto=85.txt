Bioinformatics and Computational Biology BS - Biomedical Informatics Concentration
Use electronic health records to prevent future pandemics. Help analyze genetic data to develop new cancer drugs. Create advanced computer models that lead to more resilient ecosystems. If these things sound interesting to you-and if you like using science, math, data and statistics-then this program could be exactly what you’re looking for. This program is for students who want a highly interdisciplinary major, with the freedom to focus on biology, computer science or informatics (using data to improve health).
Visit the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Biomedical Informatics department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
Admission Criteria
Minimum 2.000 GPA overall
Minimum 3.000 prerequisite major GPA required
Current UB students who are interested in applying to the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology BS - Biomedical Informatics Concentration in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences should submit the Program Application.
