Electrical Engineering BS
Electricity runs the world-which means electrical engineers have the power to change lives. As one of our students said, “One day I’m learning about new renewable energy technologies that could save the planet, and then the next day I’m learning about cutting-edge nano-robots that are used to combat cancers.” If you’ve ever taken apart a computer or appliance to figure out how it works-or if you think that sounds cool-then this is the major for you. 
Visit the Electrical Engineering academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.

Two EE upper-division technical electives
Three unrestricted upper-division technical electives, see Academic Advising Report (AAR) for a complete list of course options.
Technical Electives (15 Credits)
During their Junior and Senior year, students may choose to enroll in technical electives of interest. Technical electives allow undergraduates flexibility to concentrate in the broad areas of energy systems, optics and photonics, communications, signal processing and networking, and solid state electronics or to concentrate on a specific theme that may combine courses from several areas.
There are two types of electives: unrestricted technical electives and technical electives restricted to be taken from EE.
Three unrestricted technical electives: in principle, any 300 or 400 level course of technical nature may be considered as an unrestricted technical elective (for example, courses from SEAS, the Department of Mathematics, the Department of Physics, and others). Some restrictions may apply in cases in which courses have a large overlap with other courses in the program.
Two EE technical electives: Any 300 or 400 level course from the Electrical Engineering department (that is not a required course) may be considered as a technical elective.
Details on EE technical electives can be found in the UB course catalog.
Total Credits Required for Major: 109
Additional Degree Requirements Include:
Additional coursework to fulfill UB Curriculum requirements
Elective courses as needed to complete the 126 credit hour total
Total Credits Required for Graduation: 126
Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Notes
*Students are permitted to take alternative programming courses EAS 230 or CSE 115 in lieu of EAS 240, however EAS 240 is strongly preferred for Electrical Engineering majors. The alternative programming courses should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with EAS 230, CSE 115, or EAS 999TRCP (general programming for transfer students) already completed. View our Computer Programming Requirement website for more information on the programming alternatives and self-study packages. 
**Students are permitted to take CSE 241 in lieu of EE 178, however EE 178 is strongly preferred for Electrical Engineering majors. CSE 241 should only be used if the student has already completed this course or is considering a double major in Computer Engineering. 
***Students are permitted to take EAS 305 in lieu of EE 305, however EE 305 is strongly preferred for Electrical Engineering majors. The EAS 305 option should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with EAS 305 already completed or when significant extenuating circumstances prevent a student from completing EE 305  in a timely manner. In the latter case, students should consult the department before enrolling in EAS 305.
****Students are permitted to use PHY 151 and PHY 152 in lieu of PHY 158, however PHY 158 is preferred for engineering majors.
*****Students are permitted to take EAS 200 in lieu of EE 202, however EE 202 is strongly preferred for Electrical Engineering majors.EAS 200  should only be used if the student has already completed this course prior to switching majors to Electrical Engineering. 
Academic Requirements
Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must have a minimum GPA of 2.000 in technical classes (engineering, math, and science classes) to be in good standing and graduate with an undergraduate degree.  To maintain academic standards and determine eligibility for continued enrollment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences reviews the academic records of all students in an approved undergraduate SEAS major. This academic review is conducted at the end of each fall and spring semester. View the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Academic Review Policy
Transfer Credit Policy
Students seeking an undergraduate engineering degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must complete 30 undergraduate credit hours of junior/senior level courses required in their major at the University at Buffalo.
