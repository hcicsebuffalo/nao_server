So if you want to make your mark on the world-and make anything you can imagine-then art might be the perfect program for you. You’ll get to use your creativity and explore how art helps you better understand yourself, your community, and the larger social, cultural and political contexts in which you exist.

Learning Outcomes
The Emerging Practices (Art & Technology) concentration’s curriculum is a multidisciplinary studio practice that builds on knowledge of emerging technologies such as interactive multi-media, electronic installation, networked telematic communication, robotic art, three-dimensional simulation, biotechnology, and algorithmic image synthesis. Emerging Practices (Art & Technology) engages the latest technologies, scientific processes and best practices available. It also reclaims, alters and appropriates existing technologies through creative re-use for communicative cultural purposes. Students engage in deeply experimental technological creative practices, positioning them to anticipate and shape future art movements, media forms and research fields.
The BFA degree focuses on intensive work in Emerging Practices (Art & Technology), supported by a smaller, more defined program of general studies in the liberal arts.&nbsp;Students in the BFA also take a 2-semester capstone course, resulting in a senior thesis exhibition. Because this option includes the development of a cohesive body of work, the BFA is considered particularly relevant for students who wish to continue on to an MFA program.
