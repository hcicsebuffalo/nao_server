Fine Arts MFA
The Department of Art unites the disciplines of art, art history, and visual studies and aesthetics. Practicing artists and designers are expected to cultivate the relationship of research, theory and history to their work. Concurrently, art historians, theorists, and curators are compelled to engage multiple visual platforms and environments beyond the traditional discourse of art. The emphasis of our programs on interdisciplinary practice, supported by the University at Buffalo’s comprehensive research facility, is at the core of our departmental mission.
