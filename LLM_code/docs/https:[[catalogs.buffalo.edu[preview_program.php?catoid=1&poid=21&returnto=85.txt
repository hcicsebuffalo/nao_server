Asian Studies BA
Given that most people on this planet live in Asia, if you want to make a difference in this world, it helps tremendously to understand Asian culture, politics and economies. Whether you’re interested in an international career, want to study the relationship between Asia and the U.S., or simply want a non-Western perspective, the Asian studies major is a practical choice that prepares you to lead the way.
Visit the Asian Studies academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Asian Studies department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
Admission Criteria
