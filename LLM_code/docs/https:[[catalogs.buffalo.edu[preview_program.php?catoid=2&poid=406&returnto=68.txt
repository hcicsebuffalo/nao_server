Curriculum
Throughout your coursework, you will study key principles of public health, community health and health behavior, and statistical and research methodology. You will also design an individualized course plan for gaining advanced knowledge in a focal area of study related to community health and health behavior.
Beyond formal coursework, the program is based on a mentor-mentee, apprenticeship model. This means that you will be involved with a faculty member’s research throughout your time in the program.
Upon completion of your coursework, you’ll complete a comprehensive exam. The exam has two parts: a written exam focused on your knowledge of key principles, theories and research in community health and health behavior, and a writing component focused on your knowledge and research design skill in your focal area of study.
