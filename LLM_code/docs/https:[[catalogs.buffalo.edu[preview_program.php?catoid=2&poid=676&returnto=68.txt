Faculty Mentorship and Supervision
Our program fosters collegial and intellectually stimulating interactions between students and faculty, in order to prepare students to become the next generation of cognitive scientists. The graduate student’s primary faculty contact is with his or her mentor, however, our program is designed to facilitate interaction with a broad range of faculty members outside classes. Students form an Individualized Mentoring Committee in the first year, which is a committee of three faculty members: the advisor and two others (one of whom must be from the cognitive area). In addition, students complete a project that is mentored by faculty members other than the primary advisor (these are termed Qualifying Projects).
