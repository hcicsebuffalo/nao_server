Economics MA
Economics is a science that deals with the allocation of scarce resources to satisfy competing ends. It deals with choices that individuals, corporations, investors and governments make to maximize individual welfare, as well as with the way that efficient markets, trade, and exchange operate to enhance economic growth, and social welfare. Our internationally distinguished faculty provide our students knowledge that will help expand their employment and earning opportunities in the private and public sectors, and apply economic principles in their daily lives.
