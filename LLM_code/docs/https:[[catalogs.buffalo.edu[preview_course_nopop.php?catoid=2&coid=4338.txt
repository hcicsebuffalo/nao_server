AAP 514SEM - Int’l Issues Theatre Mgmt
The field of theatre management is becoming increasingly complex as circuits depend on national and international collaborations. Theatre managers therefore need to develop a lateral understanding of this subject knowing when there are legal and fiscal considerations to be taken into account which correspond distinctly to different cultural environments. This seminar style course will address research in the field of international theatre and venue management. The course will follow a series of themes - including marketing, fiscal management, venue management, and leadership. The emphasis is given to historical overview of the field, case studies, and contemporary issues in the field.
