  PharmD/MS Curriculum Notes
Students may enter the MS after their P1 year. Their first year in the MS consists of only MS courses. Each candidate must meet all degree requirements of each school.
Second and third year students begin the MS curriculum in the academic year immediately following admission.
First year students are generally advised to begin the MS curriculum after completing second year but can choose to pursue the MS after first year based on their academic background and preparation for graduate study.
Students rejoin the PharmD curriculum after completing the MS coursework, which takes two semesters. They continue to do research on their MS project during the remaining time in the PharmD program.
