2023-2024 Graduate Catalog
Graduate Degree & Course Catalog
The policies and requirements listed in the graduate catalog are in effect for the entirety of the academic year. Online catalogs are archived in March of each academic year, and the archived versions may be accessed through the links in the Archived Catalogs navigation or by contacting the Graduate School. 
Calendars, academic and degree programs, policies and fees are subject to change at any time by official action of the University at Buffalo or the State University of New York. 
Departmental websites and departmental curricular and course information are maintained independently and do not necessarily reflect university-approved curricula and course information. In case of discrepancies between departmental information and the University Graduate Catalog, the University Graduate Catalog is considered definitive.
