Biomedical Engineering BS
Are you interested in biology, medicine and engineering but can’t decide which one to pick? UB’s biomedical engineering (BME) program lets you explore all of your interests in one do-it-all major. If you get excited about things like making 3D models of the brain to improve cancer care, designing wearable medical sensors, and using artificial intelligence to prevent cardiac deaths-and you’re good at science and math-then BME could be exactly what you’ve been looking for.
Visit the Biomedical Engineering academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Biomedical Engineering department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.

Notes
* Students are permitted to take BIO 201/BIO 211 in lieu of BE 202, however BE 202 is strongly preferred for Biomedical Engineering majors. The BIO 201/BIO 211 option should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with these courses already completed or when they are pursuing a pre-health major that requires BIO 201/211.
**Students are permitted to take alternative programming courses EAS 240 or CSE 115 in lieu of EAS 230, however EAS 230 is strongly preferred for Biomedical Engineering majors. The alternative programming courses should only be utilized by students transferring into the program with EAS 240, CSE 115, or EAS 999TRCP (general programming for transfer students) already completed. View our Computer Programming Requirement website for more information on the programming alternatives and self-study packages.
***Students are permitted to use PHY 151 and PHY 152 in lieu of PHY 158, however PHY 158 is preferred for engineering majors.
****Only one informal course (496, 498, or 499) offered by the Biomedical Engineering Department or other department may count as a technical elective. Only students who have completed BE curriculum courses through and including third year fall courses can register for BE 496 , BE 498 , or BE 499  for TE credit.
Special Notes: Not all courses are offered every year or every semester, you should utilize the class search in HUB to determine if the course is being offered. Undergraduate students who take BE 400-level courses cannot retake the same course as a Graduate student at the 500-level.
***** The following MTH courses are not accepted: MTH 306, MTH 399, MTH 411, MTH 458, MTH 459, MTH 495, MTH 496, MTH 497, MTH 499 
Special Notes: Not all courses are offered every year or every semester, you should utilize the class search in HUB to determine if the course is being offered. You may request to take courses other than those listed. You must make the request to the Undergraduate Director for approval by emailing the Academic Coordinator the course syllabus for review.
Academic Requirements
Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must have a minimum GPA of 2.000 in technical classes (engineering, math, and science classes). to be in good standing and graduate with an undergraduate degree. To maintain academic standards and determine eligibility for continued enrollment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences reviews the academic records of all students in an approved undergraduate SEAS major. This academic review is conducted at the end of each fall and spring semester.
View the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Academic Review Policy
Students seeking an undergraduate engineering degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences must complete 30 undergraduate credit hours of junior/senior level courses required in their major at the University at Buffalo.
