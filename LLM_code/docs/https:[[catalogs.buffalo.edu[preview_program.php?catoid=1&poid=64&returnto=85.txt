Computational Physics BS
If you like physics-and you like technology and computers-why choose just one to study? At UB, we’ve combined physics and computer science (two of our most popular programs!) into one fascinating major. Here, you can explore matter and energy and how the physical world works, while also learning how to solve problems using advanced computing techniques. If you want to stand out from the crowd, keep reading and see how a computational physics degree can help you.
Visit the Computational Physics academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Physics department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
Admission Criteria
Current UB students seeking admission to the Computational Physics BA will be added to the major upon request by completing the College of Arts and Sciences Major/Minor Change Request Form.

Total Credit Hours Required represents the minimum credits needed to complete this program, and may vary based on a number of circumstances. This should not be used for financial aid purposes.
Program Honors
A student must excel in course work as well as complete a Senior Thesis.  The Senior Thesis is prepared under the supervision of a Department of Physics faculty member. Credit for this is obtained through PHY 497. The thesis is reviewed by the student’s mentor and the Undergraduate Director. The thesis should be at least 20 pages long and the student must have completed at least one semester of PHY 497. 
Students must also meet the remaining criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. Students who successfully complete the honors program and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript.
Academic Requirements
Minimum GPA of 2.500 in the following courses: PHY 107, PHY 108, PHY 117, PHY 118, PHY 158, MTH 141, and MTH 142.
Curricular Plan
A Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time. Your actual plan may vary depending on point of entry to the university, course placement and/or waivers based on standardized test scores, earned alternative credit and/or college transfer credit.
