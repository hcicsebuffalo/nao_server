APY 543SEM - Cognitive Anthropology
Cognitive anthropology is a field that considers human thinking as a cultural and social, as well as a psychological (or computational) phenomenon. it regards cognition as closely interconnected with cultural forms, social systems, and everyday activities. it also takes the very notion of “cognition” itself as a cultural product whose social and historical origins require investigation.
