In addition, all students are required to take the Core Courses in three of the four core fields of study:
American Politics 
Comparative Politics 
International Politics
Public Law
Students then proceed to more advanced study in their specialized fields.
Research Seminars and Qualifying Papers
All PhD students are required to complete two Research Seminars and complete a professional-quality qualifying paper in one of their two major fields. The qualifying paper is evaluated by three faculty in the field. Students who satisfy the above requirements and complete the qualifying paper are then permitted to take the Comprehensive Examinations.
Skill Requirement
The four Department Core Courses (above) will provide students with the basic skills required to conduct research in the discipline. In addition, the language and skill requirements may vary for each student in the PhD program. The student’s dissertation committee is responsible for ensuring that the student possesses the skills necessary for the dissertation research and may require additional research skills (e.g., languages, advanced statistics).
Comprehensive Examinations
Comprehensive examinations are scheduled each semester. Candidates will be examined either on two major fields of specialization, or one major and two minor fields. The exams will test understanding of the major concepts, methodology and literature encompassed by the program, and will consist of written questions and an oral examination. The comprehensive examinations may be taken only after the student has completed the Department Core Course Requirement, fulfilled major/minor field requirements, and submitted one satisfactory qualifying paper.
Doctoral Dissertation Requirement
After passing the comprehensive examinations, a student will nominate a dissertation committee, subject to the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies. The committee will consist of a chairperson and at least two other faculty members from within the department and one from outside. The dissertation proposal must be defended by the middle of the fifth month of the semester immediately following that in which the comprehensive exams are passed. Passage of the oral defense constitutes permission to proceed with the writing of the dissertation. Final approval of the dissertation rests with the dissertation committee, and involves both the approval of a reader drawn from the Graduate School faculty outside the department and an oral defense of the completed work.
