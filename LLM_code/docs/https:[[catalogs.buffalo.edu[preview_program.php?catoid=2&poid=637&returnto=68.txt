Sociology PhD
The Department of Sociology conducts innovative research, while also remaining committed to teaching and mentoring students. Students in the graduate program gain an in-depth understanding in the department’s areas of expertise (family and the life course; law and social policy; social inequalities; urban and community; work, occupations and institutions) while also benefiting from close, collaborative relationships with faculty. This unique combination of academic rigor and faculty mentoring prepares students to be first-rate researchers.

Degree Requirements
The requirements for the PhD degree include 72 credit hours of graduate study, composed of 36 credits of graded coursework and 36 credits of professionalization, research, or dissertation supervision credits.  A grade of B or higher is needed for all required coursework. Written approval must be obtained before taking courses outside the Department that will count towards meeting the credit hour requirements for Sociology graduate degrees. No more than six credit hours from courses taken outside the Department are counted towards meeting the PhD credit hour minimum requirements, and these external courses will replace internal professionalization/research credits rather than elective credits except under extraordinary circumstances.
Students entering directly from their undergraduate program earn their MA en route to their PhD. Students with an MA degree in Sociology applying from another program may be able to transfer up to six course credits (if taken within the last five years) at the discretion of the Graduate Committee, but they cannot waive or transfer credits for required courses. The Graduate Committee will also review that student’s MA thesis and determine whether an additional MA will be required or not. For students with an MA degree not in Sociology, we generally do not transfer in credits, so those students will complete an MA degree en route to the PhD. The Department’s graded course work requirement and course transfer policy are more stringent than the Graduate School’s.
