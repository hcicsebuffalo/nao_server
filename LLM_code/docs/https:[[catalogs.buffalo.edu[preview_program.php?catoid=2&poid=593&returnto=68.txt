PhD Program in Biomedical Sciences
The PhD Program in Biomedical Sciences (PPBS) is the portal for entry into ten PhD programs in the biomedical sciences: biochemistry; biomedical engineering; computational cell biology, anatomy and pathology; genetics, genomics and bioinformatics; microbiology and immunology; neuroscience; oral biology; pharmacology and toxicology; physiology and biophysics; and structural biology. Whether you’ve already decided on a field of interest or if you’re undecided, the PPBS program is structured to allow you to explore different fields of research and laboratories before selecting one of these specialized areas.
