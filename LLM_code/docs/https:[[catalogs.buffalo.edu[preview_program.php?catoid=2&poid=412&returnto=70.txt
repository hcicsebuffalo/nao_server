Computational Cell Biology, Anatomy and Pathology PhD
The Computational Cell Biology, Anatomy and Pathology PhD program is a unique connector between the basic and clinical sciences. New technology has enabled tools for examination of biological structure in both macroscopic and microscopic worlds, and has facilitated powerful computational approaches for integrating those data with other modes including molecular, genetic, and biochemical information. Imaging, mechanical, electrical and optical biosensors, and high-resolution tissue and cellular microscopic evaluations, can be married with the new analytics of machine vision and machine learning to obtain insight into biomedical mechanisms.
