French Language and Literature PhD
The Department of Romance Languages and Literatures (RLL) trains students to develop new knowledge about the languages, literatures and cultures of the Romance languages, as well as the cultures and diasporic communities with which they have remained in sustained contact. Students in RLL are prepared to participate in critical discussions in the discipline and engage meaningfully with the scholarship of colleagues in neighboring disciplines.

Curriculum
Some graduate courses from the core curriculum offer surveys of a particular period, genre or linguistic discipline, and students are encouraged to take advantage of such courses when they are offered. However, many graduate courses are more specialized classes designed to give students research experience with non-canonical texts, new ideas and innovative approaches that may later inform directly or indirectly the direction taken in the dissertation. These various components, along with the language requirement, prepare students to conduct research and contribute to their fields.
Students must complete at least 20 graduate courses (60 credits). A total of 10 courses (30 credits) of relevant coursework may be transferred from another institution. Graduate courses are designed to introduce students to a particular topic and to prepare them to do research in the field. Assessment is based primarily on a major research project and associated assignments leading up to it. The PhD program allows students the flexibility to design their own program of study in consultation with their advisor, but they must take at least one course in each general area of their field.
