Business Administration (Full Time) MBA
Do you want to work smarter, rise faster, pursue your passion, chart a new path and challenge yourself to achieve your fullest potential, all while positively impacting the world and being rewarded financially? There are several reasons why the UB MBA program is the elite MBA program in the State University of New York (SUNY) system, and one of the top MBA programs in the country. Renowned faculty, high-caliber students, outstanding services and successful alumni, are just a few of the reasons our MBA program is an excellent choice. Our full-time MBA program admits in the fall only.
The MBA is a valuable credential that can be paired with a number of professional degrees, offering advanced business training concurrently to students pursing professional credentials.  The School of Management offers 6 such “collaborative” offerings:  the MBA/AuD for speech pathologists, the MBA/Real Estate Development MS for planners and developers, the MBA/DDS for aspiring dentists, the MBA/MPH for public health professionals, and the MBA in combination with our surgical residency, for surgeons-in-training.
