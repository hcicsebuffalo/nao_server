UB’s Commitment to Web Accessibility
The University at Buffalo is committed to the ideal of universal web accessibility and strives to provide an accessible web presence that enables all university constituents and visitors full access to information provided on its websites. Every effort has been made to make these pages as accessible as possible in accordance with the applicable state and federal guidelines (see NYS-P08-005
).
The university’s web presence is comprised of thousands of sites that are managed and maintained by individual departments and sponsoring organizations. The quickest way to have a web accessibility issue addressed is to contact the owner of the website directly. Alternatively, please email ub-webaccess@buffalo.edu (please include the URL of the website you were on) and someone will follow up with you about your concern.
