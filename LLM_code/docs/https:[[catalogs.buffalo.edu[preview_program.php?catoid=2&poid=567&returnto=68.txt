Neuroscience PhD
The neuroscience program is an interdisciplinary undertaking of research and education, offering doctoral and master’s degrees. The program encompasses over 75 faculty members in clinical and basic science departments throughout the university. The goal is to provide maximal academic flexibility that matches the broad scope of modern neuroscience. The emphasis is on interactions between five main areas: cellular and molecular mechanisms of nervous system function and dysfunction, development and plasticity, sensory systems, behavioral neurobiology, and translational medicine in the nervous system.

Requirements and Curriculum
If you are interested in the Neuroscience PhD program, you should apply directly to the PhD Program in Biomedical Sciences (PPBS), where you will participate in a core curriculum in the first semester. Beginning in your second semester, you would have the option to take Neuroscience courses as electives and select your thesis advisor and research topic. 

The PhD requires 72 credits, including at least 20 credits of didactic courses and the remainder composed of a mix of didactic and research credits. Most of the didactic course requirements can be completed in the first year. You must receive a grade of B or higher on all required courses, with an overall GPA above 3.0.

The Neuroscience program has a set of required courses (NRS 520, NRS 524, NRS 601, and NRS 602 and PMY 516). In addition, you can select from a variety of elective courses upon consultation with your mentor.
