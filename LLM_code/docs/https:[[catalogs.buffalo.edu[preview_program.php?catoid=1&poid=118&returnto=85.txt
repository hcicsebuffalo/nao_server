Physics BA
Think big-or small-or anywhere in between. From subatomic particles to the ever-expanding universe, physics explains the natural phenomena all around us, and serves as the foundation for chemistry, astronomy and many other scientific fields. If you have questions about how the world works, physics is where you’ll find the answers. Whether you want to discover black holes, invent faster computer chips or become a teacher, physics lets you be a force in the world.

Academic Requirements
Minimum major GPA of 2.0 required for graduation.
Program Honors
A student must excel in course work as well as complete a Senior Thesis.  The Senior Thesis is prepared under the supervision of a Department of Physics faculty member. Credit for this is obtained through PHY 497. The thesis is reviewed by the student’s mentor and the Undergraduate Director. The thesis should be at least 20 pages long and the student must have completed at least one semester of PHY 497. 
Students must also meet the remaining criteria outlined in the Academic Honors policy. Students who successfully complete the honors program and meet the criteria will have the appropriate notation on their official transcript.
Curricular Plan
A Curricular Plan provides a roadmap for completing this academic program and the UB Curriculum on time.
