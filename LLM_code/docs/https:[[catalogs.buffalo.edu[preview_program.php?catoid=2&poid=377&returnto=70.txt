Business Analytics MS
With a Master of Science in business analytics from the School of Management, you’ll gain a combination of technical, managerial and communication skills, allowing you to rise to leadership positions in organizations worldwide.
Take advantage of the overwhelming demand for data analysts in every industry by focusing on the skills the employers want: data-driven decision-making, data visualization and business intelligence. Beyond technical skills, employers say storytelling is both the most critical and frequently missing skill in the analytics toolset. Storytelling is what turns data scientists into leaders who solve business problems.
