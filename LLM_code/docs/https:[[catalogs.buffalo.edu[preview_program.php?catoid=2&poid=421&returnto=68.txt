Critical Museum Studies MA
The Department of Art offers an MA in Critical Museum Studies; a two-year, 36-credit program of study conceived according to a more traditional pedagogical model, with a broad distribution of courses across a wide geographical and chronological span. Less modern and contemporary in focus than our visual studies degrees, the MA in Critical Museum Studies is ideal either as a stepping-stone to a doctoral program in art history or as a credential degree for a museum/gallery career. Learn how this degree will prepare you for employment.
