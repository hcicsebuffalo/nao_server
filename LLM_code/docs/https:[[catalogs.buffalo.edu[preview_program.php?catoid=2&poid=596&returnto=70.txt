Physical Therapy DPT
The Physical Therapy DPT program is a fully accredited, three-year professional program that leads to the Doctor of Physical Therapy. Students earn the DPT degree at UB through two paths: a 3 + 3 combined Exercise Science BS/DPT, where students major in undergraduate exercise science for three years, or a traditional 4 + 3 program, where students have already earned their four-year BS degree. The three-year physical therapy program focuses on clinical populations, teaching the assessment and treatment of individuals with a wide variety of ailments. Students apply to the DPT program through Physical Therapy Centralized Application Service (PTCAS).
