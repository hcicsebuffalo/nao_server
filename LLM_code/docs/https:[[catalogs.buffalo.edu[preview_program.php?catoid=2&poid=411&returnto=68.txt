Computational Cell Biology, Anatomy and Pathology MS
The MS program in Computational Cell Biology, Anatomy and pathology provides research training in biological form and function, the quantitative analysis of biological structure science and the modeling of biological systems. Our faculty are engaged in cell and developmental biology, bioimaging and neuroscience, with a strong emphasis on computational approaches that can derive unique insight from complex data sets. While our program is particularly strong microscopic anatomy and cell biology, we aim to produce scientists with knowledge of biological principles at all levels of scale, and who are enabled by proficiency in imaging methodology and data analysis.
