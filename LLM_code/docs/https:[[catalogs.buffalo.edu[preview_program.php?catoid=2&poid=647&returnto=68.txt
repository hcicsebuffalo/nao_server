Social Work MSW/JD
The JD/MSW program enables students to develop an in-depth knowledge of social and legal systems to positively change the lives of individuals and communities. This collaborative program between the School of Law and School of Social Work allows students to earn both Juris Doctor (JD) and Master of Social Work (MSW) degrees and reduces the amount of time and credits compared to completing the programs separately. The JD/MSW program offers both traditional and advanced standing tracks and incorporates our signature trauma-informed and human rights perspectives.

420 hour foundation field placement + law clinic that doubles as advanced field placement
Students can choose to begin in the Law School or School of Social Work. However, we recommend that you begin the program in the School of Social Work, as this course sequence allows consistent contact with your law cohort in the last three years of the program.
