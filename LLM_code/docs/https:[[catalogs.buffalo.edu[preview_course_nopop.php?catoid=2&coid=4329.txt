AAP 503SEM - Arts Develop & Fund Raise
While fundraising has always been an essential part of nonprofit arts management in the U.S., more recent upheavals in the global economy have made fundraising a priority for many arts managers around the globe. This course introduces students to the historical origins of modern philanthropy, current fundraising and development trends, and the practice of fundraising and development in the arts. The aim of the course is to train students in practical aspects of fundraising by examining types of donors and their motivations, the design of fund-raising plans and targets, the tools of fundraising, and methods of solicitation. Through readings, case analysis, guest speakers, role-playing, solicitation dialogues and presentations, students will analyze the components of effective fundraising and development, and devise and implement practical fundraising tools and techniques.
