Applied Economics - International Economics Specialization Advanced Certificate
The program in international economics is a cooperative venture of the Departments of Economics and Geography, and the School of Management. Students will be trained to understand the forces that influence international trade and economic development, the balance of payments, international capital mobility and fluctuations in the currency markets.
Students will also examine opportunities for and barriers to trade, the geography of trade and the increasing globalization of corporate activity and all markets. The collapse of the command economies of eastern Europe; the swift pace of economic reforms in China and other East Asian countries; and the creation of free-trade blocks in Europe, in the Pacific Rim, and on our own continent have intensified the movement of goods and services, financial and human capital, technology transfers, direct foreign investment and joint ventures.
