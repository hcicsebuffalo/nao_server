Economics BS
Whether you’re trying to reduce poverty, decide whether to buy or lease a car, or figure out how a company can make the best use of its employees’ time, you’re using economics. As an economics major, you’ll see exactly how we apply economics every day in our professional and personal lives. UB’s economics program is designed for people who want to make the world better (and more efficient) by understanding how we distribute money, land and other limited resources.
