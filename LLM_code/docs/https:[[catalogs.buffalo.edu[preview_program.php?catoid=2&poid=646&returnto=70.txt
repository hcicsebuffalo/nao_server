Social Work MSW/MBA
The MSW/MBA program applies managerial and economic principles to social work practice and enables students to earn both a Master in Business Administration (MBA) and a Master of Social Work (MSW). This collaborative program between the UB School of Management and the UB School of Social Work reduces the time and credits compared to completing the programs separately. The MSW/MBA program offers both traditional and advanced standing tracks. Both MSW/MBA course of study options are full-time and on-campus only and incorporate our signature trauma-informed and human rights perspectives.
The MBA is a valuable credential that can be paired with a number of professional degrees, offering advanced business training concurrently to students pursing professional credentials.  The School of Management offers 6 such “collaborative” offerings:  the MBA/AuD for speech pathologists, the MBA/Real Estate Development MS for planners and developers, the MBA/DDS for aspiring dentists, the MBA/MPH for public health professionals, and the MBA in combination with our surgical residency, for surgeons-in-training.  Contact the School of Management for more information about these time-saving “collaborative” program opportunities.
