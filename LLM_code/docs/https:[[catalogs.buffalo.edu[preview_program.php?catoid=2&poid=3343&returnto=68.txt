Engineering Education PhD
The Engineering Education PhD Program bridges education research, theory and practice in engineering disciplines across the university and trains engineers to provide innovative educational experiences through practices of experiential learning, inclusion and accessibility, and other best practices in education. The PhD in Engineering Education program will prepare students to successfully conduct rigorous engineering education research, disseminate the results of that research to other engineering education scholars and translate their findings into classroom practice. The PhD program will provide a thorough introduction to concepts, theories, models, frameworks and pedagogies that are central to engineering education and learning. It will equip students to use a variety of qualitative and quantitative research methods and apply them in their selected area of specialization as they develop their engineering education scholarship and expertise.
