PhD Qualifying Exam
You’ll prepare a written dissertation research proposal - including a literature review and a progress report of your preliminary studies - and defend it before our faculty.
If your faculty advisor and our program director have concerns about your knowledge and readiness to proceed with your proposed research after your presentation, you may be asked to take a written exam as well.
After successfully completing this process - typically at the end of your second year and no later than the end of your fifth semester - you’ll become a PhD candidate in our program.
Dissertation Research
You’ll conduct your thesis research under the supervision of your primary faculty advisor, who will also chair your dissertation advisory committee.
Once you pass your qualifying exam, you and your advisor will select two to three members of UB’s graduate faculty to serve on your committee. Including your primary advisor, at least two of these committee members must have primary faculty appointments in our department, and at least one must have a primary appointment in another UB department.
You’ll regularly update committee members on your research progress, and they will offer feedback and advice in return.
You’ll write your thesis as an original contribution to the scientific, peer-reviewed literature. You’ll also complete an oral defense of your research methods and results before your committee, and present your thesis in a public seminar.
Other Program Requirements
During both your first and third years of study, you’ll be required to:
complete an online self-study course on the protection of human research subjects
attend two in-person training session on good research practices
You’ll also be expected to contribute to our departmental Journal Club. We require that you participate in at least half of these sessions during your first two years in the program and at least a quarter of them during your last three.
Our PhD candidates regularly attend and present at our departmental seminars as well.
During your first two years in our program, you’ll be required to attend at least half of these presentations; during your last three years, you’ll be required to attend at least a quarter of them and give at least one presentation.
