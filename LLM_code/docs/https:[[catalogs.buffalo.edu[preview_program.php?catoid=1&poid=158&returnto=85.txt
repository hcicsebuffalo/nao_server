French BA
It’s the official language in dozens of countries around the globe, spoken on nearly every continent, the origin of roughly one-third of English words, and the so-called “language of love.” Need more reasons to study French? At UB, you’ll join students, like you, who enjoy studying languages, learning about people who live in different countries, and exploring culture through literature, art, history and media. If that sounds très bien to you, then keep reading.
Visit the French academic program page for more information about the academic experience, who you will learn from, opportunities outside of class and what you can do with this degree.
Visit the Romance Languages and Literatures department page for contact information, a brief overview of the department and the curricular options.
