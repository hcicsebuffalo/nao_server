Innovative Writing Advanced Certificate
The Innovative Writing Advanced Certificate presents a unique form of graduate study in creative writing, closely intertwining the practice of writing with literary and aesthetic inquiries. The program creates a collaborative space in which we reflect on the ethical and political implications of creative writing within the matrix of global citizenship; tease out evident and obscured connections between contemporary and historical texts; consider how aesthetic concerns are inflected by various systems of power; and create rigorous, sensuous, contentious-above all, evocative-forms of writing that embody imaginative and forward-thinking strategies.
