Humanities Interdisciplinary: Disability Studies MA
Through a non-medical and non-clinical interdisciplinary curriculum, the Humanities Interdisciplinary MA program with a concentration in disabilities studies, seeks to provide students with the knowledge base and theoretical means to question conventional understandings of the normal body, and mind. Both core and elective courses in the program are oriented toward an analysis of historical, anthropological, sociological, and literary texts on disability, and the lives of people with disabilities. The program is a perfect complement to an education in medical and clinical fields, for professionals and pre-professionals.
