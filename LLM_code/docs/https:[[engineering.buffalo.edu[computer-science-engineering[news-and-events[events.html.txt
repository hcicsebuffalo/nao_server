Events! Occasions to celebrate, collaborate, network, build, and share (knowledge, food, and drink).
CSE Departmental Anniversaries
Find out what happened at our 25th, 40th, and 50th departmental anniversaries. 
CSE Commencements
We celebrate commencement each May with a semi-formal dinner and awards ceremony.
CSE Demo Days
At the end of the semester, student groups from several CSE capstone classes present the culmination of three months of effort, hard work, (metaphorical) blood, sweat (well... caffeine really), and tears (see above). 
CSE Distinguished Speaker Series
The CSE Distinguished Speakers Series (DSS) invites internationally-recognized scholars to share their most innovative and exciting work with the CSE community.
CSE Industrial Career Days
So far, we've hosted one CSE Industrial Career Day, in conjunction with our CSE 50th Anniversary Kickoff Mixer, on November 4, 2016.
CSE Symposia
Symposia are conferences or meetings in which we discuss particular research topics in depth.
CSE Transitions
Well wishes to our senior faculty as they step away from the department to prioritize other life goals.
CSExplore
A 3-day camp for high school girls that teaches the fundamentals of computing.
Russell L. Agrusa CSE Student Innovation Competition
Russ Agrusa (BS ’76) generously donated $250,000 to establish the Russell L. Agrusa CSE Student Innovation Competition fund in late 2020. 
UB Hacking
UB Hacking is the University at Buffalo's official student-run hackathon. Students are invited to gather at our event to create cool and innovative projects within 24 hours and showcase their achievements. Just bring your laptop (and other personal hygiene products) and we'll prepare the food and swag for a memorable weekend!
UB is actively monitoring developments related to COVID-19. Please check with event organizers for the most up-to-date information about scheduled events.
