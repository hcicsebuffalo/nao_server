Music Theory MA
The program in music theory builds upon a curriculum that is deeply rooted in the best theoretical traditions, while also exploring innovations in the field. Our working assumption is that the goal of music theory is to serve music, and that the best theorists are those who have the most interesting things to say about the music they care about. Graduate seminars in tonal theory constitute parallel streams for all graduate students, culminating in analysis seminars and theoretical projects.
