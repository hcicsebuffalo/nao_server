Experiential learning gives you substantial preparation to enter the scientific and engineering professions and helps you explore future career options.  Many program graduates credit these experiences with giving them a competitive advantage during job searches and a smoother transition to full-time employment.
The department and school place significant emphasis on real-world experience.  We invite you to participate in as many of these programs as you like.
CSE Experiential Learning Initiatives
Internships
You'll earn hands-on, real-world experience by taking internships at companies related to your major.
Professional and Student Organizations
We strongly encourage you to join one or more professional and student organizations. These groups are supportive, collegial, and purpose-driven. They're ideal environments to find new friends and build your professional network.
SEAS Experiential Learning Initiatives
Engineering Intramurals
An engineering intramural is any problem-based extracurricular engineering activity that provides an authentic (i.e., “real-world”) learning experience for students.
Internships and Co-Ops
Students are eligible to earn academic credit for internships and co-ops that may fulfill degree requirements.
Shared Instrumentation Laboratories
UB’s Science and Engineering Equipment and Instrumentation Portal (EQUIP) of Shared Facilities provides cost-effective access to precision laboratories, tools and equipment for electronic device development, and the study and analysis of materials.
Tinkering
DREAM (formerly Tinkering) is the first step in the ELP continuum. Students pursue self-led, hands-on practice as a precursor to being involved in more significant activities.
