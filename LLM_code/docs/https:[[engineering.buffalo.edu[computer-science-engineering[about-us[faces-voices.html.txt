Meet a few of our students and recent alumni.
Student Profiles
“I enjoy how research-oriented the professors are, and how open they are to working with undergraduates.”
Alex Liu
Computer science student
“Students need to be exposed to basic, preliminary engineering concepts before high school. You've got to get them in the pipeline in middle school. Make it fun, creative, exciting.”
Lavone Rodolph
Computer Engineering BS '03, MS '05, PhD Candidate '19
"I'm amazed by what I was able to do in CSE's student server room. I can bring up and manage a whole network infrastructure."
James Droste
Computer Science BS '17
"My favorite part about the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers is the amount of career opportunities that come with being involved with the club."
Sebastian Cisneros
Computer science student
"The atmosphere among professors to cooperate on joint projects is really good.  It leads to very many top-tier papers and works."
Zhan Qin
PhD '17
"My pitch at open house is that UB is really big but our department's really small and you can find your way around."
Meg Arnold
Computer Science BS and Mathematics BA '17
“Through student clubs I have found a sense of community with people that motivate me and inspire me every day. ”
Lisa Kanbur
Computer science student
"Here, there are different career opportunities, good opportunities in industry as well."
Luigi Di Tacchio

"To the aspiring Black engineers, there is more than enough space in the industry for your knowledge and creativity and your input is needed, wanted and valued."
Kendra Claiborne
BS'15, computer science
"Getting to know my professors helped a lot. They're phenomenal."
Dominique Hickson
Computer Engineering BS '17
“UB is such a big campus, but computer science is a well-knit community if you choose to be a part of it.”
Sanjee Choudhery
Computer Engineering BS '17
"Build those connections with your professors– whether you like it or not, those professors are going to notice your face, when you participate, and how you perform."
Holliday Sims
Computer science student
"Research is a change process.  From being scared at first to being interested in it."
Aosen Wang
