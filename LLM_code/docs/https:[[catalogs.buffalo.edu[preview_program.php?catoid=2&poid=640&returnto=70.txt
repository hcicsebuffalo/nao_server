Social Welfare Online DSW
Our online DSW program builds on the signature strengths of the School of Social Works’ trauma-informed and human rights (TI-HR) perspective, and is aimed at experienced social workers with a desire to advance their professional practice. DSW students will have the opportunity to build knowledge and learn to more effectively incorporate these concepts into the implementation and evaluation of evidence-based treatments with vulnerable populations. As a part-time, fully online program that is accessible to students regardless of geographic location, the DSW capitalizes on the latest digital technologies to innovate social work education and practice.
